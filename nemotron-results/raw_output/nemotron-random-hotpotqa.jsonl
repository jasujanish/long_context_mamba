Bennett was a part of the space missions that have a primary destination of what celestial body?", "predicted": "\nPassage 6:\nVoyager 1\nVoyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977. It was the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. As of 2023, it is about 24.3 billion kilometers (15.1 billion miles) from Earth. It is traveling at a speed of about 17 kilometers per second (38,000 miles per hour) relative to the Sun. It is expected to exit the heliosphere and enter interstellar space in the 2030s.\nVoyager 1 was launched as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System. It was launched on September 5, 1977, 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. The two spacecraft were launched to take advantage of a favorable alignment of the outer planets. Voyager 1's trajectory took it to Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2's trajectory took it to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. After completing its primary mission, Voyager 1 continued on its trajectory, heading out of the Solar System. It is now in interstellar space, where it is studying the environment of the heliosphere and the interstellar medium.\nVoyager 1 carries a golden record containing sounds and images selected to represent life and culture on Earth. The record is intended to be a message to any extraterrestrial life that might find it. The record includes sounds of nature, music from various cultures, and a message from then-NASA administrator James E. Carter.\nVoyager 1's mission has provided valuable data about the outer Solar System and the interstellar medium. It has discovered new moons, studied the magnetic fields of planets, and measured the radiation environment in the outer Solar System. Its continued operation has allowed it to study the heliosphere and the interstellar medium, providing insights into the boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.\nVoyager 1 is expected to continue operating until at least the 2030s, when its power supply is expected to be depleted. It is a testament to human ingenuity and our desire to explore the unknown.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about the primary destination of the space missions that Gary L. Bennett was part of. From Passage 1, it is stated", "actual": ["Sun"]}
