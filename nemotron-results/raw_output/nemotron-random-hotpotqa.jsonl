The party's stated goals are to promote the values of democracy, individual liberty, and free markets, and to promote traditional British values. The party is generally considered to be right-wing, although it has been described as centre-right in some contexts.\n\nThe party was founded in 1834 as the Tory Party, and was renamed the Conservative Party in 1922. It has been led by a series of prominent figures, including Benjamin Disraeli, Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher, and David Cameron. The party has a strong presence in the House of Commons, and has won a majority of seats in several general elections.\n\nThe Conservative Party is known for its support of free-market economics, and its opposition to social welfare programs. It is also known for its support of traditional British values, such as the monarchy and the Church of England. The party has a strong base in rural areas and among older voters.\n\nThe Conservative Party has a long history of supporting the British Empire, and has been involved in several wars, including the First and Second World Wars.

It is the largest Baptist denomination in the world and the second-largest Protestant denomination in the United States. The SBC is a voluntary association of local churches that share a common Baptist faith and mission. It is not a hierarchical organization, but rather a loose confederation of churches that operate independently. The SBC is known for its strong emphasis on the authority of the Bible, the autonomy of local churches, and the importance of evangelism and missions.\n\nHistory\nThe SBC was founded in 1845 in Augusta, Georgia, as a result of a split within the Baptist denomination over the issue of slavery. The Southern Baptists, who supported slavery, broke away from the Northern Baptists, who opposed it. The SBC has since grown to become one of the largest Christian denominations in the United States.\n\nBeliefs\nThe SBC adheres to the Baptist Faith and Message 2000, which outlines its core beliefs. These include the belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, the authority of Scripture, the Trinity, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection, and the second coming of Christ. The SBC also emphasizes the importance of evangelism and missions, and the autonomy of local churches.\n\nOrganization\nThe SBC is organized into state conventions, which are in turn organized into the national convention. The national convention is held annually and is responsible for setting the agenda for the denomination. The SBC has a number of committees and agencies that work on various issues, including evangelism, missions, and social justice.\n\nControversies\nThe SBC has been involved in several controversies over the years. One of the most notable was the debate over the ordination of women, which the SBC has consistently opposed. The SBC has also been criticized for its stance on social issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and racial justice. In recent years, the SBC has faced criticism for its support of Donald Trump and its handling of the #MeToo movement.\n\nConclusion\nThe Southern Baptist Convention is a significant religious organization in the United States, with a rich history and a strong commitment to evangelism and missions. Despite its controversies, the SBC continues to play a major role in American Christianity.\n</think", "actual": ["2013"]}

The name \"Fallow deer\" is mentioned in Passage 6, which is a separate passage. The name \"fallow\" is derived from the deer's color, and the scientific name is Dama. \n\nNow, looking at the other passages to see where fallow deer are mentioned. Passage 1 is entirely about fallow deer, discussing their taxonomy, name, and distribution. The question is asking for other areas that share this species. The forests of Mara and Mondrem had fallow deer, so other areas where fallow deer are present would be the answer.\n\nIn Passage 1, under taxonomy, it mentions that the fallow deer is found in various regions.

When this collaboration, \"Handle with Care\", was deemed too good for such a limited release, the group agreed to record a full album. The album was recorded primarily over a ten-day period in May 1988, to allow for Dylan's limited availability as he prepared for the start of what became known as his Never Ending Tour and for Orbison's tour schedule. These sessions were held in the house of Eurythmics member Dave Stewart, in Los Angeles. The five band members sat in a circle playing acoustic guitars in Stewart's kitchen; once each song's basic track had been written and recorded there (with accompaniment from a drum machine), the group recorded their vocals in another room, usually after dinner each night. Petty recalled that, as a friend but also an avowed fan of Dylan's, Harrison felt the need to clear the air on the first day by saying to him: \"We know that you're Bob Dylan and everything, but we're going to just treat you and talk to you like we would anybody else.\" Dylan replied: \"Well, great. Believe it or not, I'm in awe of you guys, and it's the same for me.\"\n\nRecording\nThe album was recorded primarily over a ten-day period in May 1988.

The chassis was designed by Neil Oatley, Steve Nichols, Matthew Jeffreys, David North, David Neilson, Paddy Lowe and Henri Durand, with Mario Illien designing the bespoke Ilmor engine. It was driven by Finn Mika H\u00e4kkinen, who was in his fourth full season with the team, and Briton David Coulthard, who moved from Williams.\n\nOverview\nBackground\nMcLaren had endured a mostly disappointing season in 1996, with the MP4/11 beset by handling and reliability problems in the team's first year in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, although it did score two podiums and regular points. The second year of the arrangement was to be far more productive with both performance and reliability improved, but the team had yet to make the serious breakthrough necessary to challenge the \"big three\" of Williams, Ferrari and Benetton.\n\nPre-season testing\nIn pre-season testing, which took place at Estoril in February 1997 and Silverstone in March, four-times world champion Alain Prost was brought in as a technical advisor to test-drive the MP4/12 in H\u00e4kkinen's absence, who was still recovering from his near-fatal crash during qualifying for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nRacing history\nThe car's best result came in Monaco, with Coulthard finishing a close second to Olivier Panis' Ligier at the end of a chaotic race. However, Coulthard was outscored and generally outpaced by his teammate.\nThe car was developed throughout the season, with improvements initiated to eradicate an initial handling imbalance in time for Coulthard to lead the first 19 laps in San Marino.  On the MP4/11, a small additional wing was mounted on the engine cover, but this was removed in mid-1995.  The wing was brought back for the MP4/12 in Monaco, and was also used at Hungary.  A \"B\" version of the chassis was developed for Silverstone, and H\u00e4kkinen responded with four podium finishes from then until the end of the season.\n1997 was also notable for McLaren losing its long-term Marlboro sponsorship at the end", "actual": ["Mika H\u00e4kkinen"]}

His half-brother was Pope John XI. At the wedding of his mother to King Hugh of Italy, Alberic and his new stepfather quarreled violently after Hugh slapped Alberic for clumsiness.

It is located on Route 43, south of Crystal Lake and east of West Sand Lake.\nThe Sand Lake Baptist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\n\nDemographics\nHistory\nOriginally known only as part of greater Sand Lake, the community along with neighboring towns grew with the nineteenth-century development of wool and cotton textile manufacturing by local watermills and knitting factories along the Wynants Kill tributary of the Hudson River. By the 1880s, several independent local mills produced hosiery, undergarments, and knit shirts.The hamlet was named Averill in 1880 after a local leading family, then in 1882 renamed Averill Park in promotion of local summer-resort development and of the Troy & New England Railway, a never-completed trolley and freight line intended to connect the city of Troy, New York with the mills and summer resorts of Averill Park and its \u201cupstate Coney Island\u201d recreational Crystal Lake Beach, and with the mills of the neighboring town of West Sand Lake.The local mills declined after the increasing efficiency of steam and electrical power improved competition from regional factories, and were then destroyed by a 1891 river flood. The Faith Knitting Company (later Faith Mills), founded in 1897, restored local industry by buying and re-equipping the old mills and rehiring local labor. Other late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century firms included Jake Warger\u2019s Dry Goods Store; Gilbert Beebe\u2019s blacksmith shop; Stout\u2019s Hardware; and Park Pharmacy, where Jerry Lewis worked as a soda jerk in 1942 when his father was a superintendent at Faith Mills.Mid-nineteenth- to early twentieth-century seasonal hotels included Al\u2019s Place, Hilke\u2019s Averill Park Hotel (previously housing Scram\u2019s Collegiate Institute), Traveler\u2019s Rest (aka Sand Lake House, Tillotson\u2019s Hotel,", "actual": ["1,693"]}

The town runs from the west to the east border of the county in its northern section. The population was 39,087 at the 2020 census. The name comes from the Dutch word Haverstroo meaning \"oats straw\", referring to the grasslands along the river. The town contains three villages, one of which is also known as Haverstraw. Haverstraw village is the original seat of government for the town, hosting the area's historic central downtown business district and the densest population in northern Rockland County.\n\nHistory\nIn 1609, the region was explored by Henry Hudson. A land purchase was made in this town in 1666 from local natives and confirmed as a patent in 1671.  The region was known as Haverstroo, meaning \"oat straw\" in Dutch.\nDuring the American Revolution, it served as an important lookout for British activities on the Hudson. A blue-marked trail, the Long Path, may be taken 2 miles (3 km) eastward from Central Highway along the crest of South Mountain to High Tor. Halfway is Little Tor, the second highest peak on South Mountain.\nThe town of Haverstraw was formed in 1788 while still part of Orange County, New York.  Haverstraw was partitioned in 1791 to form the town of Clarkstown and the town of Ramapo and again in 1865 to form the town of Stony Point.\nIn 1826 the town was the site of a short-lived effort to establish an Owenite colony called the Franklin Community. Underfinanced and wracked by internal dissent, the model Owenite community folded after a mere five months of operation.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.4 square miles (71.0 km2), of which 22.2 square miles (57.4 km2) is land and 5.3 square miles (13", "actual": ["810"]}

Since annexation, Hawaii's white-dominated oligarchy comprised three branches: the HSPA and Big Five sugar plantations dominated economics, the Republican Party dominated politics, and the white minority dominated society. These organs supported each other: one important example was that the plantations were a crucial source of Republican votes. On Election Day, the crude election booths allowed plantation management to survey which worker voted Republican or not; those who did not were disciplined or fired. While several workers had the right to vote, they valued their livelihood more than their right to choose their candidate.:\u200a76\u200aRacism was not only a social issue but more importantly an economic one. Hawaii\u2019s plantation economy relied on the ready availability of cheap labor to work the fields, and any increase in wages was costly as pay was distributed over the large work force. For the white planters, the two largest groups \u2014 the Japanese and Filipinos \u2014 rivaled each other, dividing the labor force so that when one group went on strike the other would become strike breakers. But in 1920 the Japanese and Filipinos reconciled their differences and joined in the dual strike of 1920.\n\nFarrington\nAfter the 1920 strike, greater attention was given to the Asian majority. At the time, half of public school students were of Japanese ancestry. The white minority petitioned Governor Charles J. McCarthy for racial segregation to prevent their children for being exposed to what they believed to be the \"corrupting influences\" of the colored students. McCarthy had little sympathy for the immigrant Asian population and agreed to create English Standard Schools for whites and some Hawaiians, who were given privileges over students attending the more prevalent public schools.

The program was run by the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps and was authorized by President Harry S. Truman. The program was designed to bring German scientists to the United States to work on the development of the American space program. The program was named after the code name for the operation, \"Paperclip,\" which was used to refer to the operation in the early years.\n\nBackground\nThe program was initiated in 1945, after the end of World War II. The U.S. government was interested in recruiting German scientists because of their expertise in rocketry and other fields. The U.S. government believed that these scientists could help in the development of the American space program.\n\nRecruitment\nThe U.S. government recruited German scientists through a variety of means. Some scientists were recruited through the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps, while others were recruited through the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. government also used the help of former Nazi officials to recruit scientists.\n\nOperation\nThe operation was carried out in secret. The U.S. government did not want the public to know about the program, as it was seen as a way to gain an advantage in the Cold War. The scientists were brought to the United States under false pretenses. They were told that they were coming to the United States to work on scientific research, but in reality, they were being recruited to work on the American space program.\n\nLegacy\nOperation Paperclip was a successful program.

The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The roe is a small deer, reddish and grey-brown, and well-adapted to cold environments. The species is widespread in Europe, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, from Scotland to the Caucasus, and east as far as northern Iran.\n\nEtymology\nThe English roe is from the Old English r\u0101 or r\u0101ha, from Proto-Germanic *raih\u00f4, cognate with Old Norse r\u00e1, Old Saxon r\u0113ho, Middle Dutch and Dutch ree, Old High German r\u0113h, r\u0113ho, r\u0113ia, German Reh. It is perhaps ultimately derived from a PIE root *rei-, meaning \"streaked, spotted or striped\".The word is attested on the 5th-century Caistor-by-Norwich astragalus \u2013 a roe deer talus bone, written in Elder Futhark as \u16b1\u16a8\u16c7\u16ba\u16a8\u16be, transliterated as ra\u00efhan.In the English language, this deer was originally simply called a 'roe', but over time the word 'roe' has become a qualifier, and it is now usually called 'roe deer'.The Koin\u00e9 Greek name \u03c0\u03cd\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, transliterated 'pygargos', mentioned in the Septuagint and the works of various writers such as Hesychius, Herodotus and later Pliny, was originally thought to refer to this species (in many European translations of the Bible), although it is now more often believed to refer to the addax. It is derived from the words pyge 'buttocks' and argo 'white'.\nThe taxonomic name Capreolus is derived from capra or caprea, meaning 'billy goat', with the diminutive suffix -olus. The meaning of this word in Latin is not entirely clear: it may have meant 'ibex' or 'chamois'. The roe was also known as capraginus or capruginus in Latin.\n\nTaxonomy\nLinnaeus first described the roe deer in the modern taxonomic system as Cervus capreolus in 1758.

It is the AM counterpart to WAMC-FM (90.3 FM), which is the primary station of the WAMC network. WAMC (AM) is owned by \"WAMC Northeast Public Radio\", a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. The station's primary signal covers the Capital District, with a secondary signal covering parts of eastern New York, southern Vermont, Western Massachusetts, and the Litchfield Hills region. The station is also heard in parts of New Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey via a network of repeaters. WAMC (AM) is a member of National Public Radio (NPR) and American Public Media.\n\nHistory\nWAMC (AM) signed on the air in October 1958. It was the first station to be licensed in Albany, New York. The station was put on the air by the local hospital and medical school, Albany Medical Center and Albany Medical College. The affiliation with Albany Medical College was the source of the call sign WAMC. In 1981, the station became an independent institution, no longer associated with the medical school.\nIn its early days, WAMC had a mostly classical music radio format. The earliest years also included broadcasts of health information and lectures from visiting medical professors. Early on, part of WAMC's regular programming was the broadcast of live concerts by the Boston Symphony Orchestra from Tanglewood and Boston. When the NPR network was founded in 1970, WAMC signed on as one of NPR's original 90 \"charter\" members.\n\nSeparating from the medical school\nAround 1980, financial pressures caused the hospital and medical school to begin divesting the station. In 1981, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license on 1400 AM was transferred to a 501c3 tax-exempt entity, WAMC, Inc., which had been set up by a group of five corporators, including the current CEO and president, Alan S.

To answer this, I need to examine the provided passages for descriptions of each. \n\nFor Mimosa, multiple passages describe species within the Mimosa genus. For example, Passage 1 states that Mimosa is a genus of \"herbs and shrubs,\" and Passage 2 specifically describes Mimosa somnians as a \"woody shrub.\" Similarly, Passage 3 describes Mimosa turneri as a \"small- to medium-sized shrub,\" and Passage 6 describes Mimosa rubicaulis as a \"large, straggling, very prickly shrub.\" These passages collectively confirm that Mimosa includes shrub species.\n\nIn contrast, Passage 8 describes Cryptocoryne as a genus of \"aquatic plants\" and specifies that they are \"commonly referred to as crypts,\" with no mention of shrubs.

In most countries, a research degree qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field or work in a specific profession. There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines.\nIn the United States and some other countries, there are also professional degrees that include \"doctor\" in their name and are classified as doctorates. \nMany universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or  other contributions to the university or society.\n\nHistory\nMiddle Ages\nThe term doctor derives from Latin, meaning \"teacher\" or \"instructor\". The doctorate (Latin: doctoratus) appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach Latin (licentia docendi) at a university. Its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term doctor referred to the Apostles, church fathers, and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.The right to grant a licentia docendi (i.e. the doctorate) was originally reserved to the Catholic Church, which required the applicant to pass a test, take an oath of allegiance, and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed access\u2014at that time essentially free of charge\u2014to all able applicants. Applicants were tested for aptitude. This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities, slowly distancing themselves from the Church. In 121", "actual": ["University"]}

The book is a semi-autobiographical account detailing 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons and anecdotes from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Sun Tzu, Socrates, Napoleon, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin.\n\nOrigins\nThe 50th Law grew out of the friendship and mutual admiration between 50 Cent and Robert Greene. Greene's book The 48 Laws of Power, which has long been a staple in the hip hop world, came to the attention of 50 Cent, who asked his manager to arrange a meeting. Greene said that he was surprised by 50 Cent's persona and was impressed by his \"Zen-like calmness\" and eye for strategy. The two began to work on a book project that would combine their two worlds.According to Greene, 50 Cent is an example of what Machiavelli called a New Prince, a leader who emerges in a time of chaos or turmoil and rewrites the rules. According to 50 Cent, Greene's books describe the laws and strategies used by hustlers on the street, even if they might not know the \"technical terms\" for what they were doing.\n\nSynopsis\nEach of the 10 chapters in the book explains a factor of fearlessness and begins by telling how 50 Cent learned this Fearless Philosophy in Southside Queens.

It is a key theme in the Gospels, particularly in the teachings of Jesus. The Kingdom of God is often described as a spiritual realm or a state of being, rather than a physical place. It is associated with the reign of God, where God's will is done on earth as it is in heaven. The concept is also linked to the idea of salvation and the transformation of individuals and society.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus, who often spoke about it in parables and parables. For example, in the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus says, \"The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches\" (Matthew 13:31-32). This parable illustrates the idea that the Kingdom of God starts small but grows to become a powerful force.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is also associated with the idea of salvation. In the New Testament, the Kingdom of God is often linked to the idea of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ. For example, in the Gospel of John, Jesus says, \"I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again\" (John 3:3). This suggests that the Kingdom of God is not something that can be achieved through human effort alone, but rather through a spiritual transformation.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is also linked to the idea of a future reign of God. In the New Testament, there are references to a future time when the Kingdom of God will be fully realized. For example, in the Book of Revelation, there are descriptions of a new heaven and a new earth, where God's kingdom will be fully established. This suggests that the Kingdom of God is not just a present reality, but also a future hope.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is a complex and multifaceted concept, with different interpretations and understandings.

It is a rare example of a hybrid pony truss that is similar to the 19th century truss design of Simeon S. Post. It was built by J. H. Cofrode & Co. of Philadelphia in 1870. It was the first iron bridge to be constructed in the town. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nThe bridge formerly carried Bolton Road, but was closed to vehicular traffic in 1975 and bypassed by a modern highway bridge in the 1980s.\nThe bridge remained open to pedestrian traffic until April 2020, when a flash flood damaged the bridge's wooden deck and it was closed to all traffic. The long-term future of the bridge is uncertain.\nThe sign commemorating Atherton Bridge states:\n\n ATHERTON BRIDGE\nThere has been a bridge at this location since early settlement. It is named for \nJames Atherton, one of the signers of the petition for incorporation of the town in 1652. The 1794 map lists the bridge as 90 feet long on a county way Lancaster\u2019s first iron bridge was placed here in 1870.\n\nTechnical information\nThe Atherton Bridge has iron compression posts that incline inward towards the center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double end posts with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the lower chord bars, and patented Phoenix columns for all inclined posts. This bridge does not make use of Simeon Post's patented joints. The floor beams support a wood plank deck.\nThe bridge is 72 feet (22 m) long and 18.5 feet (5.6 m) feet wide, and is composed of eight panels. It rests on granite abutments.\nThe bridge was photographed in 1979 by Jet Lowe of the Historic American Engineering Record, and documented in 1990 as part of the Massachusetts Historic Bridge Project. At that time, it was one of only two known examples of the Post type of truss still", "actual": ["37.5"]}
