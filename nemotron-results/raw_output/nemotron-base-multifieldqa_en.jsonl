{"input": "Is the ISR necessary for transgene reactivation?", "predicted": " Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (full medium = 1). Since independent clones may display variable reactivation responses (e.g. due to different levels of transgene expression in basal conditions), the results are not shown as means of the three clones, but as separate replicates.\nFig 8. GCN2 knockdown does not interfere with transgene reactivation in HepG2 cells.\nRelative transgene (OA1) and ATF4 mRNA abundance in HepG2-OA1 cells transfected with control (CTRL) or anti-ATF4 siRNAs, and incubated in the presence or absence of L-Histidinol (HisOH, GCN2 activator; 4 mM) for 6 h. Mean \u00b1 range of two experiments. Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (w/o HisOH = 1, top; control siRNA = 1, bottom). *P<0.05 (one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post-test; P values refer to comparisons vs. control, unless otherwise indicated).\nTo further investigate the role of GCN2 in the response to EAA starvation, we tested whether the reactivation of the transgene is affected by the inhibition of GCN2 activity. To this aim, we used the compound ISRIB, which inhibits the activation of the ISR, even in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, likely by boosting the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2\u03b1, namely eIF2B [53, 54]. HepG2-OA1 cells were stimulated with L-Histidinol, either in the presence or absence of ISRIB. As shown in Fig 5C, while the expression of CHOP is inhibited by ISRIB, as expected, the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is not affected. In addition, knockdown of the closest eIF2\u03b1 downstream effector ATF4 by siRNAs does not interfere with the reactivation of the OA1 transgene by L-Histidinol (Fig 5D). Together, these data strongly support the conclusion that GCN2 is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA starvation, either in HeLa or in HepG2 cells.\nTo further investigate the role of GCN2 in the response to EAA starvation, we tested whether the reactivation of the transgene is affected by the inhibition of GCN2 activity.

{"input": "What experimental techniques were used to study the quantum dot structures in this research?", "predicted": "\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}\n\\bibliography{references}\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe experimental techniques used to study the quantum dot structures in this research are detailed in the \"Experimental section\" and \"Results and discussion\" sections of the provided passages. Specifically, the experiments involved the use of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to probe the quantum dots. The STM/STS technique is described in the Experimental section, where it is mentioned that the experiments were performed in a commercial low-temperature STM setup operating at approximately 5 K in ultra-high vacuum. The STM/STS method was used to record topography images and differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra, which were then analyzed to obtain local density of states (LDOS) maps. These LDOS maps were crucial for identifying the quantum dot structures and their properties.\n\nAdditionally, the Results and discussion section provides further details on how the STM/STS data was used to analyze the quantum dot structures. For instance, the LDOS patterns were examined to identify discrete states and their spatial distribution, which are indicative of quantum confinement. The section also discusses the use of a one-dimensional piecewise constant potential model to interpret the experimental data, which is based on solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. This model helps in understanding the confinement of electrons and holes within the quantum dots.\n\nThe ab-initio calculations, while not an experimental technique, are mentioned in the context of supporting the experimental findings. These calculations were used to simulate the LDOS and dispersion relations for different defect combinations, providing a theoretical basis for the experimental observations.\n\nIn summary, the primary experimental technique used in this research is low-temperature STM/STS, which is essential for characterizing the quantum dot structures by measuring the LDOS and analyzing the quantized states.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe experimental techniques used to study the quantum dot structures in this research are low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS).
