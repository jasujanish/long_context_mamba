He was the son of King Frederick IV of Denmark and Louise of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow.\n\nEarly life\nChristian was born on 10 December 1699 at Copenhagen Castle as the eldest son of King Frederick IV and his spouse Louise of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow. The newborn prince was baptised the same evening with the name Christian by the royal confessor Hans Leth. His grandfather King Frederick III had died a year and a half before he was born, and as the eldest son of the ruling King he was thus Crown Prince from birth. At the age of 18, he was given a seat on the Council of State as the heir apparent to the throne.\nAs Crown Prince, Christian broadened his education by travelling in Europe, led by his chamberlain Ditlev Wibe. He was particularly impressed by the architecture in Italy and, on his return to Denmark, asked his father for permission to build a summer palace on Solbjerg, as the hill in Valby was then known, the future site of Frederiksberg Palace. The one-storey building, probably designed by Ernst Brandenburger, was completed in 1703.\nChristian was allowed to choose his future wife from a number of Protestant royal daughters in northern Germany. In 1721, he married Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark, his half-sister, daughter of his father and his first wife Louise of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow. The marriage was arranged by their father, who wanted to strengthen the royal bloodline. The couple had six children, of whom only two survived to adulthood: Frederick, who became King Frederick V of Denmark, and Princess Louise.\n\nReign\nDomestic rule\nChristian's reign was marked by a number of important reforms. He abolished the so-called vornedskab, a kind of serfdom which had applied to the peasants of Zealand since the Late Middle Ages. His efforts were largely in vain because of the introduction in 1733 of adscription (stavnsb\u00e5nd), a law that forced peasants to remain in their home regions, by which the peasantry were subjected to both the local nobility and the army. After the Great Northern War, trade and culture flowered. The first Danish theatre, Lille Gr\u00f8nnegade Theatre, was created", "actual": ["Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel"]}

She was Countess of the Palatinate herself from 1195 until her death, as the wife of the Welf count palatine Henry V.\n\nLife\nAgnes' father Conrad of Hohenstaufen was a younger half-brother of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, who had enfeoffed him with the Electoral Palatinate in 1156. A cautious and thoughtful politician, he aimed for peace and reconciliation in the Empire. Even before 1180, he had betrothed his daughter to Henry V, the eldest son of the rebellious Saxon duke Henry the Lion, in order to defuse the re-emerging conflict between the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties.\nIn 1193, however, Barbarossa's son and successor, Emperor Henry VI, wanted to create a political alliance with King Philip II of France and planned to marry his cousin Agnes to Philip II. When the young Welf scion Henry V heard of this plan, he contacted Agnes' parents. Her father avoided definitive statements on her betrothal, as he preferred a marriage with the French king, but also did not want to offend Henry V, whom Agnes revered fanatically.\nAgnes' mother Irmengard (d. 1197), daughter of Count Berthold I of Henneberg, continued to advocate her daughter's marriage with the Welf prince. A little later she took advantage of the absence of her husband, who stayed at Henry VI's court, to thwart the Emperor's plan. She invited the young Welf to Stahleck Castle, where he and Agnes were married in January or February 1194.Furious Emperor Henry VI felt betrayed and demanded that Conrad immediately annul the marriage.

He is considered a hero in Japan for his role in the Meiji Restoration, but is also considered a traitor for leading the rebellion against the new government.\n\nBiography\nSaig\u014d was born in Kagoshima, Satsuma Province, to a samurai family. He was the younger brother of Saig\u014d D\u014dsan, a prominent Satsuma daimy\u014d. He entered the Satsuma Domain's military academy at the age of 13. He was a skilled swordsman and a brilliant strategist. He was known for his loyalty to his lord, the daimy\u014d of Satsuma, and for his bravery in battle.\n\nIn 1868, Saig\u014d joined the Satsuma Domain's forces in the Boshin War, which was fought between the imperial forces and the shogunate. He played a key role in the victory of the imperial forces, and was awarded the title of baron by the new Meiji government.\n\nHowever, Saig\u014d was dissatisfied with the new government's policies, which he saw as too Westernized and too centralized. He believed that the samurai class should retain their privileges and that the government should be more decentralized. In 1877, he led a rebellion against the Meiji government, known as the Satsuma Rebellion. The rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, and Saig\u014d was killed in battle.\n\nLegacy\nSaig\u014d is considered a hero in Japan for his role in the Meiji Restoration and for his bravery in battle.

He was trained in the arts of war and leadership. He was also taught the importance of unity and the need to protect the Hawaiian people from foreign invaders. Kamehameha's early life was marked by a series of conflicts with other Hawaiian chiefs, but he managed to maintain his position as a powerful leader.\n\nUnification of the Hawaiian Islands\nKamehameha's most significant achievement was the unification of the Hawaiian Islands.

The family lived in a simple 18th-century Alpine farmhouse, called Kluppeneggerhof. Living conditions were modest, the central room was used for eating, sleeping and working. Food was prepared over a hearth in the scullery. The farmhouse is now part of the Universalmuseum Joanneum, but even today the building ensemble can only be reached by foot.\nSince this little village, consisting only of a handful of farms, had neither a church nor a school, Rosegger and the other children would have had to walk down the mountain to the larger village, St. Kathrein, in order to attend either. The way there takes two hours and as a result, Peter had very limited education, largely provided by a wandering teacher who taught him and other children from the region for a year and a half. His physical constitution was not sufficient for him to become a farmer like his father, as he was often sick and rather frail in general. So, he became understudy of a traveling tailor at the age of seventeen.\n\nSuccess as a writer\nHis interest in literature prevailed, although he earned little money. He spent what he could afford on books and soon began to write himself. Eventually, he was discovered by the publisher of the Graz-based newspaper, Tagespost, published by Dr. Svoboda.

From Passage 3, Nikolai Rubinstein is identified as the younger brother of Pyotr Karatygin. Since Nikolai Rubinstein is Pyotr's brother, he would be Pyotr's sibling-in-law if Nikolai is married. However, the passage does not explicitly state Nikolai's marital status. \n\nPassage 4 mentions Robert W. Levering as the son-in-law of Usher L. Burdick and brother-in-law of Quentin N. Burdick, but this is unrelated to Pyotr Karatygin. Passage 8 confirms that Pyotr Karatygin's brother was Vasily Karatygin (not Nikolai Rubinstein), but Vasily's marital status is not provided. \n\nNo passage explicitly identifies a sibling-in-law for Pyotr Karatygin. The closest connection is Nikolai Rubinstein as a brother, but without confirmation of marriage, this cannot be definitively stated. \n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThere is no explicit information in the provided passages identifying Pyotr Karatygin's sibling-in-law. While Nikolai Rubinstein is mentioned as Pyotr's brother in Passage 3, his marital status is not specified, making it impossible to confirm him as a sibling-in-law.

He was succeeded by his son, Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor.\nPassage 11:\nIsabella of Bourbon\nIsabella of Bourbon (1434 \u2013 25 September 1465) was the second wife of Charles the Bold, Count of Charolais and future Duke of Burgundy. She was a daughter of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon and Agnes of Burgundy, and the mother of  Mary of Burgundy, heiress of Burgundy.\n\nLife\nNot much is known about Isabella's life. She was the daughter of the reigning Duke of Bourbon, and his Burgundian wife, Agnes, daughter of John the Fearless, the powerful Duke of Burgundy.\nAlthough her father was politically opposed to his brother-in-law, Philip the Good, he betrothed Isabella to Charles the Bold, only legitimate son and heir of Burgundy as a condition of truce. She married Charles on 30 October 1454 at Lille, France, and they were reportedly very much in love, perhaps because of (or causing) her husband's faithfulness.In 1459, Isabella stood godmother to Joachim, the short-lived son of the refugee Dauphin of France and his second wife, Charlotte of Savoy. Upon his succession to the throne of France, the Dauphin abandoned his wife in Burgundy, leaving the young Queen Charlotte dependent on Isabella's aid.\nAfter several months of illness, Isabella died of tuberculosis in Antwerp aged 31.\n\nTomb\nIsabella's early death meant that she had little significance or influence during her lifetime, but in death she became a symbol of the power of the Dukes of Burgundy, which would later be inherited by her only daughter Mary. As the duke's second marriage failed to produce a son, Mary was heiress to the duchy, and her marriage to a Habsburg had major repercussions for centuries.\n\nIsabella's funeral monument was built in the church of St. Michael's Abbey, Antwerp in 1476. It was decorated with 24 brass copper alloy statuettes of noblemen and women standing in niches, now known as 'weepers' or 'mourners', placed above a bronze effigy of Isabella.

Benjamin released an EP in 1966, featuring songs written with Dutronc and a Lanzmann-Dutronc composition, \"Cheveux longs\" (Long Hair).

The user is asking which film has the director who died earlier between \"Tiger in the Smoke\" and \"Contragolpe\". \n\nFirst, I need to find the directors of both films. From the provided passages:\n\nLooking at Passage 1, \"Traces of Smoke\" (which I think is the same as \"Tiger in the Smoke\" since the title might be a translation or alternative name) is directed by Frans van de Staak. The passage mentions it's a 1992 film. \n\nThen, Passage 2 is about \"Contragolpe\", directed by Alejandro Doria. The passage states he was born in 1936 and died on June 17, 2009. \n\nNow, I need to check if there's any other director mentioned for \"Tiger in the Smoke\". Passage 7 is titled \"Tiger in the Smoke\" and says it's directed by Roy Ward Baker. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, Passage 1 says \"Traces of Smoke\" directed by Frans van de Staak, but Passage 7 is \"Tiger in the Smoke\" directed by Roy Ward Baker. Are these the same film? The user's question refers to \"Tiger in the Smoke\", so I should focus on Passage 7. \n\nSo, \"Tiger in the Smoke\" is directed by Roy Ward Baker, who died on October 5, 2010. \"Contragolpe\" is directed by Alejandro Doria, who died in 2009. \n\nComparing the death dates: Doria died in 2009, Baker in 2010.

She has been beatified by the Catholic Church.\n\nBiography\nGisela was a daughter of Henry II, Duke of Bavaria and Gisela of Burgundy. Gisela was raised very devout, most likely with bishop Wolfgang of Regensburg as her mentor and governor. She married King Stephen I of Hungary in 996 as a part of Hungary's policy of opening up to the West. The couple had a son, Saint Emeric, who died on 2 September 1031, while hunting boar. The wedding of Stephen and Gisela marked a turning point in Hungary's history.\nQueen Gisela played a fundamental role in spreading the Christian faith and Western culture in Hungary.When Edmund Ironside of England died, he was succeeded by Cnut.

In 1046 Gisela, her attendants, and a number of many Bavarian settlers left Hungary to return to Bavaria, where she joined Niedernburg convent in Passau and became the abbess.She lived in the nunnery of Niedernburg in Passau, where she died.\n\nVeneration\nGisela's canonisation was attempted in the 18th century but failed.

He is also mentioned in the Grove Music Online.\nPassage 11:\nGretchen am Spinnrade\n\"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" (Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel), Op. 2, D 118, is a Lied composed by Franz Schubert using the text from Part One, scene 15 of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust. With \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" and some 600 other songs for voice and piano, Schubert contributed transformatively to the genre of Lied. \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" was composed for soprano voice but has been transposed to accommodate other voice types. Schubert composed \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" on 19 October 1814, three months before his eighteenth birthday.\n\nGerman text\nAnalysis\nThe song is in three sections, exactly reflecting the form of Goethe's poem. On the other hand, Schubert contradicts Gretchen's return to composure in the last three stanzas by obsessively repeating her words to create a second climax on the highest note of the song.The song opens with Gretchen at her spinning wheel, thinking of Faust and all that he had promised. The accompaniment in the right hand mimics the perpetual movement of the spinning-wheel and the left hand imitates the foot treadle. The initial key of D minor sets a longing tone as Gretchen begins to sing of her heartache (\"Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer\"). The first section progresses from D minor to C major, A minor, E minor, F major, and then returns to D minor. This, plus the crescendo, builds tension which releases only to be brought back to the beginning, much like the ever-circling spinning wheel. The song modulates to F major as Gretchen starts talking of Faust (\"Sein hoher Gang/Sein' edle Gestalt\"). The left-hand imitation of the treadle disappears and changes to block chords. Additionally, the absence of the rhythmic, consistent treadle allows Gretchen to lose her sense of stability and reality as she swoons over Faust. This section increases tension with a faster tempo, louder dynamics, and higher pitch in the soprano and peaks at Gretchen's remembrance of Faust's kiss (\"Und ach, sein Ku\u00df!\").

In Passage 1, it says he was born on 7 May 1884. That's pretty clear. Now, for Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m, I need to find his birth date. Scanning through the passages, I see Passage 9 mentions Johnny Douglas Ekstr\u00f6m was born on 5 March 1965. \n\nComparing the two dates: 1884 vs. 1965. Obviously, 1965 is much later than 1884.

Passage 1 is definitely about Hugh Evelyn Wortham with the 1884 date. Passage 9 is about Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m with 1965.
