It was the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. It is the farthest human-made object from Earth. As of 2023, it is about 24.3 billion kilometers (15.1 billion miles) from Earth. It is traveling at a speed of about 17 kilometers per second (38,000 miles per hour), which is about 35 times the speed of sound. It is expected to continue traveling for billions of years.\nVoyager 1 was launched as part of the Voyager program, a series of space probes launched to study the outer planets of the Solar System. The spacecraft was designed to study the outer planets and their moons, as well as the interstellar medium. It was launched on a trajectory that would take it past Jupiter and Saturn. After its close encounters with these planets, it continued on its journey into the outer Solar System.\nVoyager 1 was the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause, the boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space. This occurred in August 2012. The heliopause is the point where the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, is stopped by the interstellar medium, a stream of charged particles from outside the Solar System. Voyager 1's instruments detected a change in the properties of the plasma and magnetic field as it crossed the heliopause, confirming that it had entered interstellar space.\nVoyager 1 carries a golden record containing sounds and images from Earth. This record is intended to serve as a message to any extraterrestrial life that might find it. The record includes sounds of nature, music from various cultures, and a message from humanity.\nVoyager 1 is still operational and continues to send back data to Earth. Its power source is a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG), which converts the heat from the decay of plutonium-238 into electricity. The RTG will eventually run out of power, but it is expected to last until at least 2025.\nVoyager 1 is a significant achievement in space exploration. It has provided valuable data about the outer planets and the interstellar medium. It has also served as a symbol of human curiosity and our desire to explore the unknown.\n\nSee also\nVoyager", "actual": ["Sun"]}

It is the largest Baptist denomination in the world and the second-largest Protestant denomination in the United States. The SBC is a voluntary association of local churches that share a common Baptist faith and mission. It is not a hierarchical organization, but rather a loose confederation of churches that operate independently. The SBC is known for its strong emphasis on the authority of the Bible, the autonomy of local churches, and the importance of evangelism and missions.\n\nHistory\nThe SBC was founded in 1845 in Augusta, Georgia, as a result of a schism within the Baptist denomination over the issue of slavery. The Southern Baptists, who supported slavery, separated from the Northern Baptists, who opposed it. The SBC has since grown to become one of the largest Protestant denominations in the United States.\n\nBeliefs\nThe SBC adheres to the Baptist Faith and Message 2000, which outlines its core beliefs. These include the belief in the inerrancy of the Bible, the authority of Scripture, the Trinity, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ, his death and resurrection, and the second coming of Christ. The SBC also emphasizes the importance of evangelism and missions, and the autonomy of local churches.\n\nOrganization\nThe SBC is organized into state conventions, which are in turn organized into the national convention. The national convention is held annually and is responsible for setting the agenda for the denomination. The SBC has a number of committees and agencies that work on various issues, including evangelism, missions, and social justice.\n\nControversies\nThe SBC has been involved in several controversies over the years. One of the most notable was the debate over the ordination of women, which the SBC has consistently opposed. The SBC has also been criticized for its stance on social issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and racial justice. In recent years, the SBC has faced criticism for its support of Donald Trump and its handling of the #MeToo movement.\n\nConclusion\nThe Southern Baptist Convention is a significant religious organization in the United States, with a rich history and a strong commitment to evangelism and missions. Despite its controversies, the SBC continues to play a major role in American Christianity.\n\nPassage", "actual": ["2013"]}

The chassis was designed by Neil Oatley, Steve Nichols, Matthew Jeffreys, David North, David Neilson, Paddy Lowe and Henri Durand, with Mario Illien designing the bespoke Ilmor engine. It was driven by Finn Mika H\u00e4kkinen, who was in his fourth full season with the team, and Briton David Coulthard, who moved from Williams.\n\nOverview\nBackground\nMcLaren had endured a mostly disappointing season in 1996, with the MP4/11 beset by handling and reliability problems in the team's first year in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, although it did score two podiums and regular points. The second year of the arrangement was to be far more productive with both performance and reliability improved, but the team had yet to make the serious breakthrough necessary to challenge the \"big three\" of Williams, Ferrari and Benetton.\n\nPre-season testing\nIn pre-season testing, which took place at Estoril in February 1997 and Silverstone in March, four-times world champion Alain Prost was brought in as a technical advisor to test-drive the MP4/12 in H\u00e4kkinen's absence, who was still recovering from his near-fatal crash during qualifying for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nRacing history\nThe car's best result came in Monaco, with Coulthard finishing a close second to Olivier Panis' Ligier at the end of a chaotic race. However, Coulthard was outscored and generally outpaced by his teammate.\nThe car was developed throughout the season, with improvements initiated to eradicate an initial handling imbalance in time for Coulthard to lead the first 19 laps in San Marino.  On the MP4/11, a small additional wing was mounted on the engine cover, but this was removed in mid-1995.  The wing was brought back for the MP4/12 in Monaco, and was also used at Hungary.  A \"B\" version of the chassis was developed for Silverstone, and H\u00e4kkinen responded with four podium finishes from then until the end of the season.\n1997 was also notable for McLaren losing its long-term Marlboro sponsorship at the end", "actual": ["Mika H\u00e4kkinen"]}

By the 1880s, several independent local mills produced hosiery, undergarments, and knit shirts.The hamlet was named Averill in 1880 after a local leading family, then in 1882 renamed Averill Park in promotion of local summer-resort development and of the Troy & New England Railway, a never-completed trolley and freight line intended to connect the city of Troy, New York with the mills and summer resorts of Averill Park and its \u201cupstate Coney Island\u201d recreational Crystal Lake Beach, and with the mills of the neighboring town of West Sand Lake.The local mills declined after the increasing efficiency of steam and electrical power improved competition from regional factories, and were then destroyed by a 1891 river flood. The Faith Knitting Company (later Faith Mills), founded in 1897, restored local industry by buying and re-equipping the old mills and rehiring local labor. Other late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century firms included Jake Warger\u2019s Dry Goods Store; Gilbert Beebe\u2019s blacksmith shop; Stout\u2019s Hardware; and Park Pharmacy, where Jerry Lewis worked as a soda jerk in 1942 when his father was a superintendent at Faith Mills.Mid-nineteenth- to early twentieth-century seasonal hotels included Al\u2019s Place, Hilke\u2019s Averill Park Hotel (previously housing Scram\u2019s Collegiate Institute), Traveler\u2019s Rest (aka Sand Lake House, Tillotson\u2019s Hotel,", "actual": ["1,693"]}

The town runs from the west to the east border of the county in its northern section. The population was 39,087 at the 2020 census. The name comes from the Dutch word Haverstroo meaning \"oats straw\", referring to the grasslands along the river. The town contains three villages, one of which is also known as Haverstraw. Haverstraw village is the original seat of government for the town, hosting the area's historic central downtown business district and the densest population in northern Rockland County.\n\nHistory\nIn 1609, the region was explored by Henry Hudson. A land purchase was made in this town in 1666 from local natives and confirmed as a patent in 1671.  The region was known as Haverstroo, meaning \"oat straw\" in Dutch.\nDuring the American Revolution, it served as an important lookout for British activities on the Hudson. A blue-marked trail, the Long Path, may be taken 2 miles (3 km) eastward from Central Highway along the crest of South Mountain to High Tor. Halfway is Little Tor, the second highest peak on South Mountain.\nThe town of Haverstraw was formed in 1788 while still part of Orange County, New York.  Haverstraw was partitioned in 1791 to form the town of Clarkstown and the town of Ramapo and again in 1865 to form the town of Stony Point.\nIn 1826 the town was the site of a short-lived effort to establish an Owenite colony called the Franklin Community. Underfinanced and wracked by internal dissent, the model Owenite community folded after a mere five months of operation.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.4 square miles (71.0 km2), of which 22.2 square miles (57.4 km2) is land and 5.3 square miles (13", "actual": ["810"]}

It was released on September 18, 2001, by Reprise Records. The album was produced by Chris Vrenna and Clint Walsh.

Since annexation, Hawaii's white-dominated oligarchy comprised three branches: the HSPA and Big Five sugar plantations dominated economics, the Republican Party dominated politics, and the white minority dominated society. These organs supported each other: one important example was that the plantations were a crucial source of Republican votes. On Election Day, the crude election booths allowed plantation management to survey which worker voted Republican or not; those who did not were disciplined or fired. While several workers had the right to vote, they valued their livelihood more than their right to choose their candidate.:\u200a76\u200aRacism was not only a social issue but more importantly an economic one.

For the white planters, the two largest groups \u2014 the Japanese and Filipinos \u2014 rivaled each other, dividing the labor force so that when one group went on strike the other would become strike breakers.

At the time, half of public school students were of Japanese ancestry. The white minority petitioned Governor Charles J. McCarthy for racial segregation to prevent their children for being exposed to what they believed to be the \"corrupting influences\" of the colored students. McCarthy had little sympathy for the immigrant Asian population and agreed to create English Standard Schools for whites and some Hawaiians, who were given privileges over students attending the more prevalent public schools.

The program was run by the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps and was authorized by President Harry S. Truman. The program was designed to bring German scientists to the United States to work on the development of the American space program. The program was named after the code name for the operation, \"Paperclip,\" which was used to refer to the operation in the early stages.\n\nBackground\nAfter World War II, the United States was interested in recruiting German scientists to help with the development of the American space program. The U.S. government was aware that many German scientists had worked on the V-2 rocket program for Nazi Germany. The U.S. government believed that these scientists could be valuable assets to the American space program.\n\nRecruitment\nThe U.S. government recruited German scientists through a variety of means. Some scientists were recruited through the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps, while others were recruited through the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. government also used the help of former Nazi officials to recruit scientists.\n\nOperation\nThe operation was carried out in secret. The U.S. government did not want to publicize the fact that they were recruiting German scientists. The operation was carried out by the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps, which was responsible for recruiting and bringing the scientists to the United States.\n\nResults\nThe operation was successful. Many of the German scientists recruited through Operation Paperclip went on to work on the American space program. Some of the most notable scientists recruited through the operation include Wernher von Braun, who worked on the development of the V-2 rocket and later the Saturn V rocket, and Walter Dornberger, who worked on the development of the V-2 rocket.\n\nLegacy\nOperation Paperclip is considered to be a successful operation. It helped the United States to develop its space program and led to the development of the Saturn V rocket, which was used to land astronauts on the Moon. The operation is also considered to be a controversial one, as it involved the recruitment of former Nazi scientists.\n\nSee also\nOperation Highjump\nOperation Highjump\nOperation Highjump was a United States military operation during the Antarctic Campaign of World War II.

It is an epistolary novel, written as a series of letters by Wilhelm (Werther) to his friend Wilhelm (Albert). The novel is based on Goethe's own experiences, and is semi-autobiographical. It is a classic of German literature and has been widely influential in the development of the novel as a literary genre.\n\nPlot\nThe novel is set in the small town of L\u00fcneburg in the German state of Hanover. The protagonist, Werther, is a young, sensitive, and melancholic man who is deeply in love with Charlotte, a young woman who is already engaged to Albert, a man who is not as sensitive or passionate as Werther. Werther's love for Charlotte is unrequited, and he is unable to express his feelings to her. He is also plagued by a deep sense of melancholy and despair, which is exacerbated by his inability to find a way to be with Charlotte.\n\nWerther's letters to Albert describe his growing love for Charlotte and his increasing despair. He is unable to find a way to be with Charlotte, and he is increasingly isolated from his friends and family. He is also plagued by a sense of guilt and shame, as he feels that he is not worthy of Charlotte's love.\n\nAs the novel progresses, Werther's despair deepens.

{"input": "Who was the last monarch of England to be overthrown before The English General Election, 1690?", "predicted": " \nThe election was held in the context of the Exclusion Crisis, which had been ongoing since 1679. The crisis was a political dispute over whether to exclude James, Duke of York, from the line of succession to the throne. The Duke of York was the Catholic son of Charles II and was seen as a threat to the Protestant succession. The Whigs, who were opposed to James's succession, were in favor of the Exclusion Bill, which sought to bar James from the throne. The Tories, who were in favor of James's succession, opposed the Exclusion Bill. The election was seen as a referendum on the Exclusion Bill, with the Whigs hoping to gain a majority in Parliament to pass the bill, and the Tories hoping to prevent it.\n\nThe election was held in a number of constituencies across England. In some constituencies, the Whigs were able to win a majority of the seats, while in others, the Tories were able to win a majority. The results of the election were not clear-cut, and the balance of power in Parliament was not decided until after the election. The Whigs were able to win a majority of the seats in some constituencies, but the Tories were able to win a majority in others. The overall result was a hung parliament, with neither the Whigs nor the Tories having a clear majority.\n\nThe election was also marked by a number of controversies. One of the most notable was the use of the \"pocket boroughs\" by the Tories. Pocket boroughs were constituencies that were controlled by the Tories through the use of bribery and intimidation. This practice was seen as corrupt and was condemned by many Whigs. Another controversy was the use of the \"exclusion list\" by the Whigs. The exclusion list was a list of individuals who were barred from voting in the election. This list was seen as unfair and was also condemned by many Tories.\n\nThe election was also significant because it was the last parliament of Charles II. The king died in 1685, and his brother James II succeeded him. The Exclusion Crisis continued after Charles II's death, and the issue of James's succession remained a major political issue.\n\nSee also\nList of MPs elected to the English Parliament in 1681\nOxford Parliament\nExclusion Crisis\nPassage 11:\nEnglish general election, 1679\nThe 1679 English general election resulted in the ", "actual": ["King James II of England"]}

The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The roe is a small deer, reddish and grey-brown, and well-adapted to cold environments. The species is widespread in Europe, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, from Scotland to the Caucasus, and east as far as northern Iran.\n\nEtymology\nThe English roe is from the Old English r\u0101 or r\u0101ha, from Proto-Germanic *raih\u00f4, cognate with Old Norse r\u00e1, Old Saxon r\u0113ho, Middle Dutch and Dutch ree, Old High German r\u0113h, r\u0113ho, r\u0113ia, German Reh. It is perhaps ultimately derived from a PIE root *rei-, meaning \"streaked, spotted or striped\".The word is attested on the 5th-century Caistor-by-Norwich astragalus \u2013 a roe deer talus bone, written in Elder Futhark as \u16b1\u16a8\u16c7\u16ba\u16a8\u16be, transliterated as ra\u00efhan.In the English language, this deer was originally simply called a 'roe', but over time the word 'roe' has become a qualifier, and it is now usually called 'roe deer'.The Koin\u00e9 Greek name \u03c0\u03cd\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, transliterated 'pygargos', mentioned in the Septuagint and the works of various writers such as Hesychius, Herodotus and later Pliny, was originally thought to refer to this species (in many European translations of the Bible), although it is now more often believed to refer to the addax. It is derived from the words pyge 'buttocks' and argo 'white'.\nThe taxonomic name Capreolus is derived from capra or caprea, meaning 'billy goat', with the diminutive suffix -olus. The meaning of this word in Latin is not entirely clear: it may have meant 'ibex' or 'chamois'. The roe was also known as capraginus or capruginus in Latin.\n\nTaxonomy\nLinnaeus first described the roe deer in the modern taxonomic system as Cervus capreolus in 1758.

It is the AM sister station to WAMC-FM (90.3 FM), which is the primary station of the WAMC network. WAMC (AM) is owned by \"WAMC Northeast Public Radio\", a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. The station's primary signal covers the Capital District, with a secondary signal covering parts of eastern New York, southern Vermont, Western Massachusetts, and the Litchfield Hills region. The station is also heard in parts of New Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey via a network of repeaters. WAMC (AM) is a member of National Public Radio (NPR) and American Public Media.\n\nHistory\nWAMC (AM) signed on the air in October 1958. It was the first station to be licensed in Albany, New York. The station was put on the air by the local hospital and medical school, Albany Medical Center and Albany Medical College. The affiliation with Albany Medical College was the source of the call sign WAMC. In 1981, the station became an independent institution, no longer associated with the medical school.\nIn its early days, WAMC had a mostly classical music radio format. The earliest years also included broadcasts of health information and lectures from visiting medical professors. Early on, part of WAMC's regular programming was the broadcast of live concerts by the Boston Symphony Orchestra from Tanglewood and Boston. When the NPR network was founded in 1970, WAMC signed on as one of NPR's original 90 \"charter\" members.\n\nSeparating from the medical school\nAround 1980, financial pressures caused the hospital and medical school to begin divesting the station. In 1981, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license on 1400 AM was transferred to a 501c3 tax-exempt entity, WAMC, Inc., which had been set up by a group of five corporators, including the current CEO and president, Alan S.

Passage 4 explicitly states that Hardley Flood is a 49.8-hectare biological Site of Special Scientific Interest with tidal lagoons and reedbeds, which provide habitats for waterfowl. The passage also mentions that the area is part of protected sites like the Broadland Ramsar site and Special Protection Area, emphasizing its ecological significance for birds.

However, Passage 4's focus on waterfowl in Hardley Flood and the description of the common pochard as a medium-sized duck align with the question's context. No other passages provide information about Hardley Flood or waterfowl in this context.

The bark is used in traditional medicine for treating various ailments.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks whether Mimosa or Cryptocoryne is a shrub. To answer this, I need to examine the provided passages for descriptions of each. \n\nFor Mimosa, multiple passages describe species within the Mimosa genus. For example, Passage 1 states that Mimosa is a genus of \"herbs and shrubs,\" and Passage 2 specifically describes Mimosa somnians as a \"woody shrub.\" Similarly, Passage 3 describes Mimosa turneri as a \"small- to medium-sized shrub,\" and Passage 6 describes Mimosa rubicaulis as a \"large, straggling, very prickly shrub.\" These passages collectively confirm that Mimosa includes shrub species.\n\nIn contrast, Passage 8 describes Cryptocoryne as a genus of \"aquatic plants\" and specifies that they are \"commonly referred to as crypts,\" with no mention of shrubs. The habitats and growth forms described (e.g., streams, rivers, aquarium plants) do not align with the characteristics of a shrub. \n\nSince Mimosa is explicitly identified as including shrubs in multiple passages, while Cryptocoryne is not described as a shrub in any passage, the answer is Mimosa.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMimosa is a shrub, as described in multiple passages (e.g., Passage 1: \"Mimosa is a genus of about 590 species of herbs and shrubs\" [Title]; Passage 2: \"Mimosa somnians is a species of woody shrub\" [Title]; Passage 3: \"Mimosa turneri is a perennial small- to medium-sized shrub\" [Title]).

The book is a semi-autobiographical account detailing 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons and anecdotes from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Sun Tzu, Socrates, Napoleon, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin.\n\nOrigins\nThe 50th Law grew out of the friendship and mutual admiration between 50 Cent and Robert Greene. Greene's book The 48 Laws of Power, which has long been a staple in the hip hop world, came to the attention of 50 Cent, who asked his manager to arrange a meeting. Greene said that he was surprised by 50 Cent's persona and was impressed by his \"Zen-like calmness\" and eye for strategy. The two began to work on a book project that would combine their two worlds.According to Greene, 50 Cent is an example of what Machiavelli called a New Prince, a leader who emerges in a time of chaos or turmoil and rewrites the rules. According to 50 Cent, Greene's books describe the laws and strategies used by hustlers on the street, even if they might not know the \"technical terms\" for what they were doing.\n\nSynopsis\nEach of the 10 chapters in the book explains a factor of fearlessness and begins by telling how 50 Cent learned this Fearless Philosophy in Southside Queens.

It is a key theme in the Gospels and is often used interchangeably with the Kingdom of Heaven. The Kingdom of God is not a physical place but a spiritual reality that is present in the world through the work of God. It is a kingdom that is not of this world, but one that is established by God's power and will.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is often described as a reign or rule of God over all creation. It is a kingdom that is characterized by justice, peace, and righteousness. It is a kingdom that is not limited by time or space, but is eternal and universal. The Kingdom of God is not something that can be achieved through human effort or by following a set of rules. Instead, it is a kingdom that is given by God to those who believe in him and who live according to his will.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is often associated with the idea of a future eschatological event, in which God will establish his kingdom on earth. This event is often referred to as the Second Coming of Christ or the Day of Judgment. However, the Kingdom of God is not just a future event, but also a present reality. It is a kingdom that is already present in the world through the work of God and the lives of his followers.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is often contrasted with the Kingdom of this world, which is characterized by power, violence, and oppression. The Kingdom of God is a kingdom of love, compassion, and forgiveness. It is a kingdom that is open to all people, regardless of their background or beliefs.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is a central theme in the teachings of Jesus. He often spoke about the Kingdom of God and its importance. He taught that the Kingdom of God is not something that can be seen or touched, but it is something that can be felt and experienced. He also taught that the Kingdom of God is available to all people, regardless of their social status or background.\n\nThe Kingdom of God is a concept that has been interpreted in different ways by different Christian denominations.

It is a rare example of a hybrid pony truss that is similar to the 19th century truss design of Simeon S. Post. It was built by J. H. Cofrode & Co. of Philadelphia in 1870. It was the first iron bridge to be constructed in the town. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nThe bridge formerly carried Bolton Road, but was closed to vehicular traffic in 1975 and bypassed by a modern highway bridge in the 1980s.\nThe bridge remained open to pedestrian traffic until April 2020, when a flash flood damaged the bridge's wooden deck and it was closed to all traffic. The long-term future of the bridge is uncertain.\nThe sign commemorating Atherton Bridge states:\n\n ATHERTON BRIDGE\nThere has been a bridge at this location since early settlement. It is named for \nJames Atherton, one of the signers of the petition for incorporation of the town in 1652. The 1794 map lists the bridge as 90 feet long on a county way Lancaster\u2019s first iron bridge was placed here in 1870.\n\nTechnical information\nThe Atherton Bridge has iron compression posts that incline inward towards the center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double end posts with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the lower chord bars, and patented Phoenix columns for all inclined posts. This bridge does not make use of Simeon Post's patented joints. The floor beams support a wood plank deck.\nThe bridge is 72 feet (22 m) long and 18.5 feet (5.6 m) feet wide, and is composed of eight panels. It rests on granite abutments.\nThe bridge was photographed in 1979 by Jet Lowe of the Historic American Engineering Record, and documented in 1990 as part of the Massachusetts Historic Bridge Project.
