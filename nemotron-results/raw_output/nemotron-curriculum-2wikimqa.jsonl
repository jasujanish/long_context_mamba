{"input": "Who is Sobe (Sister Of Saint Anne)'s grandchild?", "predicted": "\nPassage 11:\nSister of Saint Anne\nSister of Saint Anne (also known as Sobe) was the mother of Elizabeth, who was the mother of John the Baptist. She is a figure in Christian tradition, particularly in Catholic and Orthodox theology. She is often depicted as a virtuous and pious woman, and her story is told in the Bible, specifically in the Gospel of Luke.\n\nBiblical account\nAccording to the Gospel of Luke, Sobe was one of the three sisters of Bethlehem, daughters of Matthan the priest and his wife Mary. The eldest sister was Mary, who became the mother of Jesus. The second sister was Sobe, who became the mother of Elizabeth. The youngest sister was Anne. Elizabeth was the cousin of Mary and the aunt of John the Baptist.\n\nSobe's role in the story\nSobe's role in the story is to be the mother of Elizabeth, who is the mother of John the Baptist. John the Baptist is a significant figure in Christian tradition, as he is believed to be the forerunner of Jesus. Sobe's story is not as well-known as that of her sister Mary, but she is still an important figure in Christian tradition.\n\nLegacy\nSobe is remembered as a virtuous and pious woman, and her story is often used to illustrate the importance of faith and family in Christian tradition. She is also a symbol of the importance of women in Christian history.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about Sobe (Sister of Saint Anne)'s grandchild. From Passage 1, Sobe is identified as the mother of Elizabeth, who is the mother of John the Baptist. Therefore, John the Baptist is Sobe's grandchild. Passage 10 also confirms that Elizabeth (Sobe's daughter) is a granddaughter of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and a sister of King George III, but this does not directly address Sobe's lineage. Passage 5 mentions Sobe as a sister of Anne and mother of Elizabeth, but does not specify her grandchild. The key connection is in Passage 1, where Sobe's grandchild is explicitly John the Baptist. Other passages do not provide relevant information about Sobe's descendants.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nJohn the Baptist is Sobe's grandchild, as stated in Passage 1: \"Sobe... was the mother of Elizabeth... and the grandchild of Povel Ramel.\" However, the direct answer to the question is", "actual": ["John the Baptist"]}

The user is asking which film has the director who is older than the other between \"Blue Blood And Red\" and \"The Longshot\". \n\nFirst, I need to identify the directors of both films. From the provided passages:\n\n- \"Blue Blood And Red\" is directed by Raoul Walsh. His birth year is given as 1887 (from Passage 5: Raoul Walsh was born March 11, 1887).\n- \"The Longshot\" is directed by Paul Bartel. His birth year is 1938 (from Passage 3: Paul Bartel was born August 6, 1938).\n\nNow, comparing their ages: Raoul Walsh was born in 1887, and Paul Bartel in 1938.

Yes, Passage 5 clearly states Raoul Walsh's birth year as 1887, and Passage 3 states Paul Bartel's as 1938. The difference is 51 years, so Walsh is definitely older.

He was the son of King Frederick IV of Denmark and Louise of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow.\n\nEarly life\nChristian was born on 10 December 1699 at Copenhagen Castle as the eldest son of King Frederick IV and his spouse Louise of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow. The newborn prince was baptised the same evening with the name Christian by the royal confessor Hans Leth. His grandfather King Frederick III had died a year and a half before he was born, and as the eldest son of the ruling King he was thus Crown Prince from birth. At the age of 18, he was given a seat on the Council of State as the heir apparent to the throne.\nAs Crown Prince, Christian broadened his education by travelling in Europe, led by his chamberlain Ditlev Wibe. He was particularly impressed by the architecture in Italy and, on his return to Denmark, asked his father for permission to build a summer palace on Solbjerg, as the hill in Valby was then known, the future site of Frederiksberg Palace. The one-storey building, probably designed by Ernst Brandenburger, was completed in 1703.\nChristian was allowed to choose his future wife from a number of Protestant royal daughters in northern Germany. In 1721, he visited the court of his mother-in-law, Queen Louise of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow, in Copenhagen. But his visit there was cut short by a message telling of his mother's serious illness (she had, in fact, already died in Copenhagen). Christian later returned to G\u00fcstrow, where he was forced to choose the eldest of the unmarried princesses. On 11 May 1721 at Copenhagen Castle, he married Princess Charlotte Amalie of Denmark, herself a great-great-granddaughter of Frederick II of Denmark. \nAt the death of his father on 6 August 1730, the couple became King and Queen of Denmark-Norway.

A cautious and thoughtful politician, he aimed for peace and reconciliation in the Empire. Even before 1180, he had betrothed his daughter to Henry V, the eldest son of the rebellious Saxon duke Henry the Lion, in order to defuse the re-emerging conflict between the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties.\nIn 1193, however, Barbarossa's son and successor, Emperor Henry VI, wanted to create a political alliance with King Philip II of France and planned to marry his cousin Agnes to Philip II. When the young Welf scion Henry V heard of this plan, he contacted Agnes' parents. Her father avoided definitive statements on her betrothal, as he preferred a marriage with the French king, but also did not want to offend Henry V, whom Agnes revered fanatically.\nAgnes' mother Irmengard (d. 1197), daughter of Count Berthold I of Henneberg, continued to advocate her daughter's marriage with the Welf prince.

He was trained in the arts of war and leadership. He was also taught the importance of unity and the need to protect the Hawaiian people from foreign invaders. Kamehameha's early life was marked by a series of conflicts with other Hawaiian chiefs, but he managed to maintain his position as a respected leader.\n\nUnification of the Hawaiian Islands\nKamehameha's most significant achievement was the unification of the Hawaiian Islands.

She was the daughter of the reigning Duke of Bourbon, and his Burgundian wife, Agnes, daughter of John the Fearless, the powerful Duke of Burgundy.\nAlthough her father was politically opposed to his brother-in-law, Philip the Good, he betrothed Isabella to Charles the Bold, only legitimate son and heir of Burgundy as a condition of truce. She married Charles on 30 October 1454 at Lille, France, and they were reportedly very much in love, perhaps because of (or causing) her husband's faithfulness.In 1459, Isabella stood godmother to Joachim, the short-lived son of the refugee Dauphin of France and his second wife, Charlotte of Savoy.

The term is used to describe the purge of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and the government of Germany of many people associated with Hitler's political rivalries, including the leadership of the SA (Sturmabteilung or \"Brownshirts\"), as well as some of Hitler's political opponents. The event is also known as the purge of 1934.\n\nBackground\nThe Night of the Long Knives was a result of Hitler's growing paranoia and his desire to consolidate power within the Nazi Party. The SA, led by Ernst R\u00f6hm, had become increasingly powerful and independent, which threatened Hitler's control. R\u00f6hm and other SA leaders were seen as potential rivals to Hitler's authority. Additionally, there were concerns about the influence of other political groups and individuals within the government.\n\nEvents\nOn 30 June 1934, Hitler ordered the SS and the Gestapo to eliminate perceived threats within the Nazi Party and the government. The operation was carried out with the help of the SS and the Gestapo, who arrested and executed many SA leaders, including R\u00f6hm. Other targets included political opponents and individuals who were seen as potential threats to Hitler's power.\n\nAftermath\nThe Night of the Long Knives was a significant event in the consolidation of Hitler's power. It eliminated many of his political rivals and strengthened his control over the Nazi Party and the government. The event also marked a turning point in the Nazi regime, as it demonstrated Hitler's willingness to use violence to eliminate opposition.\n\nLegacy\nThe Night of the Long Knives is remembered as a dark period in German history. It is seen as a key event in the rise of the Nazi regime and the eventual outbreak of World War II.

The series also emphasizes the idea that children can be heroes, challenging the traditional notion that espionage is a profession for adults. The use of Latino cultural elements, such as music, food, and language, is a recurring motif throughout the series, reflecting Rodriguez's heritage and adding a unique flavor to the films.\n\nMarketing and legacy\nThe Spy Kids films were marketed heavily towards children and families, with a focus on the adventure and humor elements. The series has become a cult classic, with a dedicated fanbase that appreciates its unique blend of action, comedy, and family values.

With \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" and some 600 other songs for voice and piano, Schubert contributed transformatively to the genre of Lied. \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" was composed for soprano voice but has been transposed to accommodate other voice types. Schubert composed \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" on 19 October 1814, three months before his eighteenth birthday.\n\nGerman text\nAnalysis\nThe song is in three sections, exactly reflecting the form of Goethe's poem. On the other hand, Schubert contradicts Gretchen's return to composure in the last three stanzas by obsessively repeating her words to create a second climax on the highest note of the song.The song opens with Gretchen at her spinning wheel, thinking of Faust and all that he had promised. The accompaniment in the right hand mimics the perpetual movement of the spinning-wheel and the left hand imitates the foot treadle. The initial key of D minor sets a longing tone as Gretchen begins to sing of her heartache (\"Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer\"). The first section progresses from D minor to C major, A minor, E minor, F major, and then returns to D minor. This, plus the crescendo, builds tension which releases only to be brought back to the beginning, much like the ever-circling spinning wheel. The song modulates to F major as Gretchen starts talking of Faust (\"Sein hoher Gang/Sein' edle Gestalt\"). The left-hand imitation of the treadle disappears and changes to block chords. Additionally, the absence of the rhythmic, consistent treadle allows Gretchen to lose her sense of stability and reality as she swoons over Faust. This section increases tension with a faster tempo, louder dynamics, and higher pitch in the soprano and peaks at Gretchen's remembrance of Faust's kiss (\"Und ach, sein Ku\u00df!\").
