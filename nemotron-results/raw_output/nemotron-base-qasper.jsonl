The key innovation of GhostVLAD is the addition of \"Ghost clusters\" to the NetVLAD framework. These ghost clusters are designed to absorb noisy or irrelevant features during the feature aggregation process, ensuring that only relevant features contribute to the final utterance-level representation. This is achieved by computing a matrix V that includes both normal clusters and ghost clusters, but excluding the ghost cluster vectors during the concatenation stage. The GhostVLAD pooling method is then applied to the features extracted from a ResNet-based CNN to improve language identification accuracy.

Key differences include: 1) GM_KL explicitly models multi-sense distributions via Gaussian mixtures, while others like w2g (single Gaussian) or w2gm (mixture with expected likelihood kernel) do not. 2) GM_KL incorporates entailment via asymmetric KL divergence, whereas methods like w2gm use symmetric metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) that cannot capture entailment. 3) GM_KL approximates KL divergence between Gaussian mixtures due to intractability, a step not mentioned in other approaches.

The key difference lies in the use of \u03b1-entmax instead of softmax. Softmax assigns non-zero weights to all context words, making it harder to interpret which words are truly relevant. In contrast, \u03b1-entmax (with \u03b1 > 1) allows for sparse attention weights, meaning some words can have exactly zero attention. This sparsity makes it easier to identify which words or tokens a specific attention head is focusing on, thereby enhancing interpretability. The adaptive nature of \u03b1-entmax further improves this by allowing each head to learn its optimal sparsity level, leading to more specialized and confident attention patterns.\n\nRelevant passages:\n1. \"The attention distribution of each head is predicted typically using the softmax normalizing transform. As a result, all context words have non-zero attention weight.\" [Introduction]\n2. \"For \u03b1 > 1 it permits sparse solutions, in stark contrast to softmax.\" [Background ::: Sparse Attention ::: Properties of \u03b1-entmax]\n3. \"Our work furthers the study of \u03b1-entmax by providing a derivation of the Jacobian w.r.t. the hyper-parameter \u03b1, thereby allowing the shape and sparsity of the mapping to be learned automatically.\" [Adaptively Sparse Transformers with \u03b1-entmax]\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe model improves interpretability by using \u03b1-entmax instead of softmax.

This sparsity makes it easier to identify which words are relevant to each attention head. Additionally, the adaptive \u03b1 values enable heads to learn specialized sparsity patterns, further enhancing interpretability.

Specifically, WordNet is used to generate synthetic datasets for testing models' ability to handle hypernymy, hyponymy, synonymy, and definitions. The experiments show that transformer-based models like RoBERTa perform well on definitions and synonymy probes but struggle with hyponymy, especially as the number of inferential hops increases. The passage explicitly states that WordNet is chosen for its structured lexical information, including glosses and example sentences, which allows for the creation of naturalistic questions. However, the results indicate that while models can handle certain taxonomic tasks, they face challenges with multi-hop reasoning and consistency across semantic clusters.

The provided passages discuss the use of both crowd-sourced and expert annotations in training information extraction models. Key points include:\n\n1. The paper emphasizes that while crowd-sourced annotations can be used to train models, expert annotations are preferable when practical due to higher quality. However, combining both types of data (expert for difficult instances and crowd for others) yields better performance than using either alone.\n\n2. The experiments show that re-weighting difficult sentences (predicted via difficulty scores) during training improves model performance, suggesting that not all data needs to be of high quality. Specifically, removing up to ~10% of the most difficult sentences did not harm performance, and re-weighting was effective.\n\n3. The conclusion states that the optimal ratio of expert to crowd annotations depends on cost and availability of experts. In practice, a combination of both is better than using lay data alone.\n\nThus, the amount of data required is not a fixed number but depends on balancing expert and crowd annotations. The task-specific encoder can be trained with a mix of data, where expert annotations focus on difficult instances, and crowd annotations cover the rest. The exact quantity would depend on the specific task and resources, but the key is leveraging difficulty predictions to optimize data usage.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe amount of data needed to train the task-specific encoder depends on the balance between expert and crowd annotations. The passage indicates that while expert annotations are preferable for difficult instances, combining them with crowd annotations (especially for easier instances) can achieve similar or better performance. The optimal ratio is task-dependent and influenced by cost and availability of experts. For example, re-annotating 1,000 difficult instances with experts improved performance, but even fewer expert annotations (e.g., 600) showed significant gains. Thus, the required data is not fixed but optimized by routing difficult cases to experts and using crowd data for others.

The accuracy is measured as the fraction of sentences generated by the model that exactly match the target sentence. These metrics are used to compare the proposed constrained objective approach against baselines and to assess performance in user studies. The passage directly states these evaluation criteria, making them the definitive answer.\n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe models are evaluated based on two metrics: efficiency, measured by the retention rate of tokens (the fraction of tokens kept in the keywords), and accuracy, measured as the fraction of sentences generated by the model that exactly match the target sentence [Introduction].\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["by training an autocomplete system on 500K randomly sampled sentences from Yelp reviews", "efficiency of a communication scheme $(q_{\\alpha },p_{\\beta })$ by the retention rate of tokens, which is measured as the fraction of tokens that are kept in the keywords, accuracy of a scheme is measured as the fraction of sentences generated by greedily decoding the model that exactly matches the target sentence"]}
{"input": "What evaluation metrics are looked at for classification tasks?", "predicted": " This will help in discovering new perspectives on performance. Another interesting problem is to discover the relationship between the performance attributes and the strengths, weaknesses and suggestions. This will help in understanding the impact of each attribute on the performance of employees.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about evaluation metrics for classification tasks. The provided passages discuss various classification experiments, including sentence classification into STRENGTH, WEAKNESS, and SUGGESTION classes. The evaluation metrics mentioned are precision, recall, and F-measure, which are explicitly described in the context of multi-label classification. For example, the passage states: \"Precision, Recall and F-measure for this multi-label classification are computed using a strategy similar to the one described in BIBREF21.\" Additionally, the ROUGE unigram score is mentioned for evaluating summarization, but this is not directly related to classification metrics. The key metrics for classification tasks in the text are precision, recall, and F-measure.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe evaluation metrics for classification tasks mentioned in the text are precision, recall, and F-measure.
