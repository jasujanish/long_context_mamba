The key innovation of GhostVLAD is the addition of \"Ghost clusters\" to the NetVLAD framework. These ghost clusters are designed to absorb noisy or irrelevant features during the feature aggregation process, ensuring that only relevant features contribute to the final utterance-level representation. This is achieved by computing a matrix V that includes both normal clusters and ghost clusters, but excluding the ghost cluster vectors during the concatenation stage. The GhostVLAD pooling method is then applied to the features extracted from a ResNet-based CNN to improve language identification accuracy.

This sparsity makes it easier to identify which words or tokens a specific attention head is focusing on, thereby enhancing interpretability. The adaptive nature of \u03b1-entmax further improves this by allowing each head to learn its optimal sparsity level, leading to more specialized and confident attention patterns.\n\nRelevant passages:\n1. \"The attention distribution of each head is predicted typically using the softmax normalizing transform. As a result, all context words have non-zero attention weight.\" [Introduction]\n2. \"For \u03b1 > 1 it permits sparse solutions, in stark contrast to softmax.\" [Background ::: Sparse Attention ::: Properties of \u03b1-entmax]\n3. \"Our work furthers the study of \u03b1-entmax by providing a derivation of the Jacobian w.r.t. the hyper-parameter \u03b1, thereby allowing the shape and sparsity of the mapping to be learned automatically.\" [Adaptively Sparse Transformers with \u03b1-entmax]\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe model improves interpretability by using \u03b1-entmax instead of softmax.

This sparsity makes it easier to identify which words are relevant to each attention head. Additionally, the adaptive \u03b1 values enable heads to learn specialized sparsity patterns, further enhancing interpretability.

The provided passages discuss the use of both crowd-sourced and expert annotations in training information extraction models. Key points include:\n\n1. The paper emphasizes that while crowd-sourced annotations can be used to train models, expert annotations are preferable when practical due to higher quality. However, combining both types of data (expert for difficult instances and crowd for others) yields better performance than using either alone.\n\n2. The experiments show that re-weighting difficult sentences (predicted via difficulty scores) during training improves model performance, suggesting that not all data needs to be of high quality. Specifically, removing up to ~10% of the most difficult sentences did not harm performance, and re-weighting was effective.\n\n3. The conclusion states that the optimal ratio of expert to crowd annotations depends on cost and availability of experts. In practice, a combination of both is better than using lay data alone.\n\nThus, the amount of data required is not a fixed number but depends on balancing expert and crowd annotations. The task-specific encoder can be trained with a mix of data, where expert annotations focus on difficult instances, and crowd annotations cover the rest. The exact quantity would depend on the specific task and resources, but the key is leveraging difficulty predictions to optimize data usage.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe amount of data needed to train the task-specific encoder depends on the balance between expert and crowd annotations. The passage indicates that while expert annotations are preferable for difficult instances, combining them with crowd annotations (especially for easier instances) can achieve similar or better performance. The optimal ratio is task-dependent and influenced by cost and availability of experts. For example, re-annotating 1,000 difficult instances with experts improved performance, but even fewer expert annotations (e.g., 600) showed significant gains. Thus, the required data is not fixed but optimized by routing difficult cases to experts and using crowd data for others.

We chose several target domains from educational controversies, such as homeschooling, single-sex education, or mainstreaming. A novel aspect of the corpus is its coverage of different registers of user-generated Web content, such as comments to articles, discussion forum posts, blog posts, as well as professional newswire articles.\nSince the data come from a variety of sources and no assumptions about its actual content with respect to argumentation can be drawn, we conducted two extensive annotation studies. In the first study, we tackled the problem of relatively high \u201cnoise\u201d in the retrieved data. In particular, not all of the documents are related to the given topics in a way that makes them candidates for further deep analysis of argumentation (this study results into 990 annotated documents). In the second study, we discussed the selection of an appropriate argumentation model based on evidence in argumentation research and proposed a model that is suitable for analyzing micro-level argumention in user-generated Web content. Using this model, we annotated 340 documents (approx. 90,000 tokens), reaching a substantial inter-annotator agreement. We provide a hand-analysis of all the phenomena typical to argumentation that are prevalent in our data. These findings may also serve as empirical evidence to issues that are on the spot of current argumentation research.\nFrom the computational perspective, we experimented on the annotated data using various machine learning methods in order to extract argument structure from documents.

The passage discusses pre-ordering English sentences to match the word order of the source language (e.g., SOV) to address word order divergence. Specifically, it mentions that pre-ordering involves applying rules to reorder English sentences (assisting language) to align with the source language's structure. For example, a rule swaps the position of a noun phrase followed by a transitive verb with the verb itself. This process ensures consistency in contextual representations generated by the encoder, which is critical for effective transfer learning. The passage explicitly states that pre-ordering is applied to the assisting language (English) to match the source language's word order before training the parent model. This step is highlighted as a key solution to mitigate inconsistencies caused by divergent word orders between languages.\n\nThe relevant passage is:  \n\"In our resource-scarce scenario, we have no parallel corpus for the child task. Hence, at test time, the source language sentence is translated using the parent model after performing a word-by-word translation into the assisting language.

The experiments on ShapeWorldICE datasets show that while BLEU and SPICE may correlate with truthfulness in simple cases, they fail in complex scenarios (e.g., Spatial-MultiShapes) where high BLEU scores do not reflect actual truthfulness. The GTD framework directly evaluates truthfulness by comparing captions to the ground truth world model, not just reference captions.

{"input": "How do they define robustness of a model?", "predicted": " For example, in sentiment classification, we may know that the positive class is more frequent than the negative class.\nThe KL divergence term is also robust to the number of labeled features. As shown in Figure 4 , the performance is not sensitive to the value of $\\lambda $ . This is because the KL divergence term is not directly related to the number of labeled features. It is more related to the class distribution. This is also consistent with our intuition. The KL divergence term is designed to control the class distribution, and the number of labeled features is not directly related to the class distribution. However, the KL divergence term is sensitive to the reference class distribution. If the reference class distribution is far from the true distribution, the performance will be degraded. This is because the KL divergence term will try to make the model's predicted distribution closer to the reference distribution, which may not be the true distribution. Therefore, it is important to provide a reference class distribution that is close to the true distribution.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe passage defines robustness in the context of leveraging prior knowledge in machine learning models. It emphasizes that robustness refers to a model's ability to handle biased or incomplete prior knowledge without being overly sensitive to it. For example, the text discusses scenarios where prior knowledge (e.g., labeled features) may be unbalanced or incomplete, such as having more information about one class (e.g., baseball) than another (e.g., hockey). The paper proposes methods to make models robust by introducing regularization terms that mitigate the impact of such biases. Specifically, the KL divergence term is highlighted as effective because it uses a reference class distribution to guide the model, reducing sensitivity to imbalanced prior knowledge. The passage explicitly states that robustness is achieved by reducing the model's sensibility to prior knowledge biases, ensuring reliable performance even when the knowledge is incomplete or skewed.\n\nKey citations:\n- The definition of robustness is tied to handling biased prior knowledge: \"a crucial problem... is the bias in the prior knowledge that we supply to the learning model. Would the model be robust or sensitive to the prior knowledge?\" [Introduction].\n- The goal of the proposed methods is to \"reduce the sensibility of the prior knowledge and therefore to make the model more robust and practical\" [Introduction].\n- The KL divergence term is noted for its robustness: \"Incorporating the KL divergence of class distribution performs much better than GE-FL on both balanced and unbalanced datasets\" [Experiments].\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nRobustness of a", "actual": ["ability to accurately classify texts even when the amount of prior knowledge for different classes is unbalanced, and when the class distribution of the dataset is unbalanced", "Low sensitivity to bias in prior knowledge"]}

Additionally, ALOHA demonstrates stability and robustness, performing well regardless of the character's identity, genre, or dialogue context. The human evaluation further supports these findings, showing that ALOHA's performance is relatively close to human judgments, which is a strong indicator of its effectiveness. The improvements are attributed to ALOHA's use of Human Level Attributes (HLAs) to guide response selection, which the baselines lack.

{"input": "Why masking words in the decoder is helpful?", "predicted": " We also plan to use larger pre-trained language models, such as BERT-LARGE, to improve the performance of our model.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks why masking words in the decoder is helpful. The provided passages explain that the model uses a two-stage decoding process. In the second stage, each word of the generated summary draft is masked, and the refine decoder predicts the refined word one-by-one using BERT's contextualized representations. This process is designed to address the issue of incomplete context in the left-context-only decoder by leveraging BERT's ability to model both directions of context during pre-training. Masking words allows the refine decoder to condition on the complete context (both preceding and following words) of each masked word, which improves the quality of generated sequences by reducing repetition and incoherence. This is explicitly stated in the passage: \"we design a two-stage decoding process... to make good use of BERT's context modeling ability\" and \"the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes.\"\n\nThe key passage supporting this is:  \n\"To address the above issues of previous abstractive methods... we design a two-stage decoding process...

This leverages BERT's pre-trained ability to model bidirectional context, which addresses the limitation of left-context-only decoders that lack complete context during generation. The masking process ensures the refine decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences by conditioning on a consistent input sequence aligned with BERT's pre-training.

{"input": "How does Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention works?", "predicted": " The main contributions of this paper are as follows.\nWe propose a CWS model with only attention structure. The encoder and decoder are both based on attention structure.\nWith a powerful enough encoder, we for the first time show that unigram (character) featues can help yield strong performance instead of diverse $n$-gram (character and word) features in most of previous work.\nTo capture the representation of localness information and directional information, we propose a variant of directional multi-head self-attention to further enhance the state-of-the-art Transformer encoder.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention, which is explicitly described in the provided passages. The key details are found in the section titled \"Models ::: Gaussian-Masked Directional Multi-Head Attention.\" This section explains that Gaussian-masked directional attention modifies standard scaled dot-product attention by incorporating a Gaussian weight matrix to emphasize adjacent characters. The Gaussian weight matrix $G$ is defined to prioritize closer characters, ensuring that the attention mechanism focuses more on local relationships. Additionally, the method uses triangular masks for forward and backward encoders to enforce directional constraints. The multi-head attention variant further enhances this by capturing information from different subspaces. These components collectively define how Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention operates.\n\nThe answer must be derived solely from the provided text. The passage does not mention other mechanisms or components outside the described Gaussian-masked directional multi-head attention, so no external knowledge is required.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nGaussian-masked directional multi-head attention modifies standard scaled dot-product attention by incorporating a Gaussian weight matrix $G$ to prioritize adjacent characters. The Gaussian weight $g_{ij}$ is calculated based on the distance $dis_{ij}$ between characters, ensuring higher weights for closer characters. This is combined with the attention score via a Hadamard product. Additionally, triangular masks are applied in forward and backward encoders to enforce directional constraints, and multi-head attention is used to capture information from different subspaces. This mechanism enhances the Transformer encoder's ability to capture local and directional information for Chinese word segmentation.\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["pays attentions to adjacent characters and casts a localness relationship between the characters as a fixed Gaussian weight assuming the weight relies on the distance between characters", "Gaussian-masked directional attention can be described as a function to map queries and key-value pairs to the representation of input, Gaussian-masked directional attention expects to pay attention to the adjacent characters of each positions and cast the localness relationship between characters as a fix Gaussian weight for attention, Gaussian weight only relys on the distance between characters"]}

The methodology section details the process of constructing cloze questions by leveraging document structures (e.g., introductions summarizing main content) and matching answer spans. The results show significant improvements in F1 scores when using cloze-pre-trained models compared to supervised or other semi-supervised baselines.

{"input": "What NLP tasks do they consider?", "predicted": " For example, in sentiment classification, we may know that the positive class is more frequent than the negative class.\nThe KL divergence term is also sensitive to the reference distribution. If the reference distribution is too far from the true distribution, the model will be misled. In our experiments, we set the reference distribution to be 1:1.5/1:2/1:2.5 when the true distribution is 1:2. If we set the reference distribution to 1:1/1:1/1:1, the accuracy will drop to 0.725. This suggests that we should set the reference distribution as close as possible to the true distribution. However, in practice, we may not have the true distribution. In this case, we can use the reference distribution as a rough estimation. For example, we can use the distribution of the training set as the reference distribution. Or, we can use the distribution of the test set as the reference distribution. Or, we can use the distribution of the whole corpus as the reference distribution. In our experiments, we set the reference distribution to be the distribution of the whole corpus.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe passage discusses three regularization terms used to address bias in prior knowledge for NLP tasks. The first is the neutral features regularization term, which uses common words as neutral features to prevent bias toward classes with more labeled features [Introduction].

The third is the KL divergence regularization term, which compares the predicted class distribution to a reference distribution, allowing for more accurate control of class imbalance [Method]. These terms are introduced to make models more robust to biased prior knowledge.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe three NLP tasks considered in the paper are: (1) using neutral features to prevent bias by assuming uniform distribution over classes [Introduction], (2) applying maximum entropy regularization to enforce uniform class distribution when no prior knowledge is available [Method], and (3) employing KL divergence between predicted and reference class distributions to handle imbalanced data with known or estimated class distributions [Method].\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["text classification for themes including sentiment, web-page, science, medical and healthcare"]}

The BERT-QC model achieves 0.654 MAP, a gain of +0.138 over the baseline. The BERT-QC model also achieves 0.654 MAP on the TREC-50 dataset, and 0.849 MAP on the GARD dataset. These results show that BERT-QC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple question classification datasets.\nError Analysis: We performed an error analysis on 50 ARC questions where the BERT-QC system did not predict the correct label, with a summary of major error categories listed in Table TABREF20 .\nAssociative Errors: In 35% of cases, predicted labels were nearly correct, differing from the correct label only by the finest-grained (leaf) element of the hierarchical label (for example, predicting Matter INLINEFORM0 Changes of State INLINEFORM1 Boiling instead of Matter INLINEFORM2 Changes of State INLINEFORM3 Freezing). The bulk of the remaining errors were due to questions containing highly correlated words with a different class, or classes themselves being highly correlated.
