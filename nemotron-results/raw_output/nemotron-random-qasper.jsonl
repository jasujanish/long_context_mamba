A. Al-Mashaqbeh, M. A. Al-Mashaqbeh, M. A. Al-Mashaqbeh\n]\nIntroduction\nThe proliferation of social media platforms has led to an exponential increase in the amount of information shared online. While this has democratized the flow of information, it has also facilitated the spread of fake news. Fake news, defined as false or misleading information presented as news, has become a significant concern due to its potential to influence public opinion, disrupt democratic processes, and cause social unrest. The challenge of detecting fake news in social media is complex due to the dynamic and often deceptive nature of such content.\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current approaches and challenges in fake news detection within social media. We will explore various methodologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and network analysis, and discuss the limitations and future directions of these approaches.\nMethodology\nThe survey is structured into several sections. First, we will define fake news and its implications in the context of social media. Next, we will review the existing literature on fake news detection, categorizing the approaches into content-based, metadata-based, and hybrid methods. We will then discuss the challenges faced in detecting fake news, such as the rapid evolution of fake news tactics, the diversity of languages and platforms, and the need for real-time detection. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of future research directions and potential solutions.\nContent-Based Approaches\nContent-based approaches focus on analyzing the textual content of the news articles or social media posts. These methods typically involve natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify linguistic features that are indicative of fake news. Common techniques include sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic modeling. For instance, the presence of certain keywords or unusual sentence structures can be red flags for fake news. However, these methods can be limited by the sophistication of the fake news content, which may mimic legitimate news in terms of language and structure.\nMetadata-Based Approaches\nMetadata-based approaches leverage the metadata associated with social media posts, such as the time of posting, the number of shares, the number of followers of the account, and the geographical location of the user. These features can provide valuable insights into the authenticity of the content. For example, a sudden surge in shares or a high number", "actual": ["Ground truth is not established in the paper"]}
{"input": "What is the GhostVLAD approach?", "predicted": " We hope that our work will inspire more research in the field of language identification using deep learning and GhostVLAD pooling.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe GhostVLAD approach is described in the \"POOLING STRATEGIES\" section of the provided text. Specifically, it is introduced as an extension of the NetVLAD method, which was originally developed for face recognition. GhostVLAD adds \"Ghost clusters\" to the NetVLAD framework to handle noisy or irrelevant content by excluding their contributions during feature aggregation. This modification allows the model to focus on discriminative features, improving language identification accuracy. The passage explicitly states that GhostVLAD pooling outperforms other methods like NetVLAD, Average pooling, and Statistics pooling in the experiments conducted for language identification.\n\nKey citations from the text:\n1. GhostVLAD is defined as an extension of NetVLAD with ghost clusters: \"GhostVLAD is an extension of the NetVLAD approach... which we discuss in the previous section\" [POOLING STRATEGIES].\n2.

The provided passages detail several methods, including Word2Vec (CBOW/skip-gram), GloVe, and others that handle polysemy but fail to capture entailment. The proposed GM_KL model uses a KL divergence-based energy function with Gaussian mixtures to address both polysemy and entailment. Key differences include: 1) GM_KL explicitly models multi-sense distributions via Gaussian mixtures, while others like w2g (single Gaussian) or w2gm (mixture with expected likelihood kernel) do not. 2) GM_KL approximates KL divergence between Gaussian mixtures to capture asymmetry in entailment (e.g., \"chair\" \u2286 \"wood\"), whereas symmetric metrics like cosine similarity (used in w2gm) fail here. 3) Experimental results show GM_KL outperforms others on entailment and word similarity datasets, leveraging its ability to model entailment relations.

{"input": "How does their model improve interpretability compared to softmax transformers?", "predicted": " \n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks how the model improves interpretability compared to softmax transformers. The key difference lies in the use of \u03b1-entmax instead of softmax. Softmax assigns non-zero weights to all context words, making it harder to interpret which words are truly relevant. In contrast, \u03b1-entmax (with \u03b1 > 1) allows for sparse attention weights, meaning some words can have exactly zero attention. This sparsity makes it easier to identify which words or tokens a specific attention head is focusing on, thereby enhancing interpretability. The adaptive nature of \u03b1-entmax further improves this by allowing each head to learn its own sparsity level, leading to more specialized and confident attention patterns.\n\nThe passage explicitly states that sparse attention (via \u03b1-entmax) \"eases interpretability\" and provides examples of how sparsity helps in identifying head specializations (e.g., positional heads, BPE-merging heads, interrogation heads). This is directly contrasted with softmax, which lacks such sparsity. The adaptive \u03b1 values also enable heads to vary in sparsity, further aiding in understanding their roles.\n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe model improves interpretability by using \u03b1-entmax instead of softmax, which allows for sparse attention weights. This sparsity enables attention heads to assign exactly zero weights to irrelevant words, making it clearer which tokens are relevant. Additionally, the adaptive \u03b1 values let each head learn its own sparsity level, leading to more specialized and confident attention patterns. This contrasts with softmax, which assigns non-zero weights to all words, reducing interpretability.

The passages explicitly state that traditional sarcasm detection relies on stylistic patterns (e.g., emoticons, laughter expressions) but emphasize that their work introduces cognitive features (eye-tracking data) as a novel approach.

The experiments show that transformer models perform well on WordNet-based probes, particularly for definitions and synonymy, but struggle with multi-hop taxonomic inferences. This indicates that WordNet is indeed useful for probing taxonomic reasoning, though models have limitations in handling complex hierarchical relationships.

The corpus contains 340 documents (approx. 90,000 tokens) annotated with the modified Toulmin's model. The corpus is available under free license.

The best-performing system achieved Macro- INLINEFORM0 0.251 score. This is a substantial improvement over the baseline, but still far from the human performance. The main reasons for the low performance are the lack of training data for some argument components (rebuttal and refutation), the difficulty of distinguishing between similar argument components (premise and backing), and the difficulty of identifying boundaries of argument components. The latter is a general problem in argumentation mining, as discussed in the literature BIBREF129 , BIBREF130 .\nThe results also show that the proposed model is able to generalize across domains, especially when using word embeddings. This is a promising result, as it indicates that the model can be applied to new domains without the need for extensive re-annotation.\nThe work presented in this article is a step towards building a comprehensive framework for argumentation mining in user-generated Web content. However, there are still many challenges to be addressed. For example, the model needs to be extended to capture the pathos dimension of argument, which is prevalent in user-generated content.

This paper aims to investigate the impact of fake news on Twitter, focusing on how it affects public opinion, political discourse, and the overall trust in information sources. The study analyzes a dataset of tweets related to a major political event, examining the characteristics of tweets that went viral and those that did not. By comparing these two groups, the research seeks to identify patterns that can help in detecting and mitigating the spread of fake news.\nThe methodology involves collecting a large sample of tweets using Twitter's API, focusing on tweets that were retweeted more than 1000 times, which indicates a high level of engagement. The dataset is then manually annotated by an expert to classify tweets as containing fake news or not. The analysis includes various meta-data fields such as the number of retweets, likes, mentions, and the presence of URLs or media. Statistical tests are used to determine if there are significant differences between the two groups of tweets.\nThe findings reveal that tweets containing fake news tend to have a shorter lifespan on the platform, with a higher number of retweets in a shorter period. Additionally, accounts spreading fake news often have a higher ratio of friends to followers, suggesting a more aggressive or less authentic following. The presence of URLs in fake news tweets is also more common, which may be used to direct users to malicious sites or to generate ad revenue. The study also notes that fake news tweets are more likely to be polarized, reflecting the political nature of the event being discussed.\nThe implications of these findings are significant for social media platforms and policymakers. Understanding the characteristics of fake news can help in developing better detection algorithms and strategies to combat its spread. The study also highlights the need for increased media literacy among users to critically evaluate the information they encounter online.\nIn conclusion, the research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the impact of fake news on social media. It provides insights into the mechanisms that facilitate the spread of misinformation and offers potential solutions for mitigating its effects.

The passage discusses pre-ordering English sentences to match the word order of the source language (e.g., SOV) to address word order divergence. Specifically, it mentions that pre-ordering involves applying rules to reorder English sentences (assisting language) to align with the source language's structure. For example, a rule swaps the position of a noun phrase followed by a transitive verb with the verb itself. This process ensures consistency in contextual representations generated by the encoder, which is critical for effective transfer learning. The passage explicitly states that pre-ordering is applied to the assisting language (English) to match the source language's word order before training the parent model. This step is highlighted as a key solution to mitigate inconsistencies caused by divergent word orders between languages.\n\nThe relevant passage is:  \n\"In our resource-scarce scenario, we have no parallel corpus for the child task. Hence, at test time, the source language sentence is translated using the parent model after performing a word-by-word translation into the assisting language.

The experiments on ShapeWorldICE datasets show that while BLEU and SPICE may correlate with truthfulness in simple cases, they fail to reflect true agreement in complex scenarios (e.g., Spatial-MultiShapes). The GTD framework directly evaluates truthfulness by comparing captions to the actual world model of the image, rather than relying on reference captions.

The paper proposes methods to reduce this sensitivity by introducing regularization terms that constrain the model's predictions to align with neutral features, maximum entropy distributions, or a reference class distribution.

The results show that ALOHA significantly outperforms the baselines (Kvmemnn, Feed Yourself, Poly-encoder, and BERT bi-ranker) in retrieving the correct language style of specific characters. For instance, ALOHA achieves higher Hits@1/20 scores across all five evaluation characters compared to the baselines, indicating better accuracy in selecting contextually and character-appropriate responses. Additionally, ALOHA demonstrates stability and robustness, performing well regardless of the character's identity, genre, or dialogue context. The human evaluation further supports these findings, showing that ALOHA's performance is relatively close to human judgments, which is a strong indicator of its effectiveness. The improvement is attributed to ALOHA's use of Human Level Attributes (HLAs) to guide response selection, which the baselines lack.

{"input": "Why masking words in the decoder is helpful?", "predicted": " We also plan to use larger pre-trained language models, such as BERT-LARGE, to improve the performance of our model.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks why masking words in the decoder is helpful. The provided passages explain that the model uses a two-stage decoding process. In the second stage, each word of the generated summary draft is masked, and the refine decoder predicts the refined word one-by-one using BERT's contextualized representations. This process is designed to address the issue of incomplete context in the left-context-only decoder by leveraging BERT's ability to model both directions of context during pre-training. Masking words allows the refine decoder to condition on the complete context (both preceding and following words) of each masked word, which improves the quality of generated sequences by reducing repetition and incoherence. This is explicitly stated in the passage: \"the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes\" and \"this process works as follows: first the draft decoder writes a summary draft based on a document, and then the refine decoder edits the draft.\"\n\nThe key passage supporting this is:  \n\"To further improve the naturalness of the generated sequence, we cooperate reinforcement objective with the refine decoder.\"  \nand  \n\"The refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes.\"\n\nThus, masking words enables the refine decoder to utilize BERT's full contextual understanding, leading to more natural and coherent summaries.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMasking words in the decoder is helpful because it allows the refine decoder to condition on both directions of context (preceding and following words) for each masked word, leveraging BERT's pre-trained contextualized representations. This addresses the limitation of left-context-only decoders, which lack complete context, by providing a more complete input sequence during refinement. This process improves the naturalness and coherence of the generated summaries, as stated in the passage: \"the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes\" [Text Summarization].\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["ecause this process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, therefore by using the ability of the contextual language model the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences."]}

{"input": "What NLP tasks do they consider?", "predicted": " For example, in sentiment classification, we may know that the positive class is more frequent than the negative class.\nThe KL divergence term is also sensitive to the reference distribution. If the reference distribution is too far from the true distribution, the model will be misled. In our experiments, we set the reference distribution to be 1:1.5/1:2/1:2.5 when the true distribution is 1:2. If we set the reference distribution to 1:1/1:1/1:1, the accuracy will drop to 0.725. This suggests that we should set the reference distribution as close as possible to the true distribution. However, in practice, we may not have the true distribution. In this case, we can use the reference distribution as a rough estimation. For example, we can use the distribution of the training set as the reference distribution. Or, we can use the distribution of the test set as the reference distribution. Or, we can use the distribution of the whole corpus as the reference distribution. In our experiments, we set the reference distribution to be the distribution of the whole corpus.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe passage discusses three regularization terms used to address bias in prior knowledge for NLP tasks. The first is the neutral features regularization term, which uses common words as neutral features to prevent bias toward classes with more labeled features [Introduction].

The third is the KL divergence regularization term, which compares the predicted class distribution to a reference distribution, allowing for more accurate control of class imbalance [Method]. These terms are introduced to make models robust against biased prior knowledge.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe three NLP tasks considered in the paper are: (1) using neutral features to prevent bias by assuming uniform distribution over classes [Introduction], (2) applying maximum entropy regularization to enforce uniform class distribution when no prior knowledge is available [Method], and (3) employing KL divergence between predicted and reference class distributions to handle imbalanced data with known or estimated class distributions [Method].\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["text classification for themes including sentiment, web-page, science, medical and healthcare"]}

The BERT-QC model achieves 0.654 MAP, an increase of 0.138 over the baseline. The BERT-QC model also achieves 0.654 MAP on the TREC-50 dataset, and 0.849 MAP on the GARD dataset. These results show that BERT-QC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple question classification datasets.\nError Analysis: We performed an error analysis on 50 ARC questions where the BERT-QC system did not predict the correct label, with a summary of major error categories listed in Table TABREF20 .\nAssociative Errors: In 35% of cases, predicted labels were nearly correct, differing from the correct label only by the finest-grained (leaf) element of the hierarchical label (for example, predicting Matter INLINEFORM0 Changes of State INLINEFORM1 Boiling instead of Matter INLINEFORM2 Changes of State INLINEFORM3 Freezing). The bulk of the remaining errors were due to questions containing highly correlated words with a different class, or classes themselves being highly correlated. For example, a specific question about Weather Models discusses \u201cenvironments\u201d changing over \u201cmillions of years\u201d, where discussions of environments and long time periods tend to be associated with questions about Locations of Fossils. Similarly, a question containing the word \u201cevaporation\u201d could be primarily focused on either Changes of State or the Water Cycle (cloud generation), and must rely on knowledge from the entire question text to determine the correct problem domain.
