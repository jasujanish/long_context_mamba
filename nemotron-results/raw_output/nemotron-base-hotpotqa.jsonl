It was the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. As of 2023, it is about 24.3 billion kilometers (15.1 billion miles) from Earth. It is traveling at a speed of about 17 kilometers per second (38,000 miles per hour) relative to the Sun. It is expected to exit the heliosphere and enter interstellar space in the 2030s.\nVoyager 1 was launched as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System. It was launched on September 5, 1977, 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. The two spacecraft were launched to take advantage of a favorable alignment of the outer planets. Voyager 1's trajectory took it to Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2's trajectory took it to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. After completing its primary mission, Voyager 1 continued on its trajectory, heading out of the Solar System. It is now in interstellar space, where it is studying the environment of the heliosphere and the interstellar medium.\nVoyager 1 carries a golden record containing sounds and images selected to represent life and culture on Earth. The record is intended to be a message to any extraterrestrial life that might find it. The record includes sounds of nature, music from various cultures, and a message from then-NASA administrator James E. Carter.\nVoyager 1's mission has provided valuable data about the outer Solar System and the interstellar medium. It has discovered new moons, studied the magnetic fields of planets, and measured the radiation environment in the outer Solar System. Its continued operation has allowed it to study the heliosphere and the interstellar medium, providing insights into the boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.\nVoyager 1 is expected to continue operating until at least the 2030s, when its power supply is expected to be depleted.

The distinction lies in the specific species mentioned, but the question does not specify which species to compare. Given the information, both are correct, but the answer must choose one. The passages do not provide a basis to exclude either, so the answer should state both are flowering plants. However, the question format implies a single answer. Re-examining the passages, Pueraria is a genus of legumes (flowering plants), and Pleiospilos is explicitly called a flowering plant in multiple passages.

The SBC is a voluntary association of local churches that share a common Baptist faith and mission. It is not a hierarchical organization, but rather a loose confederation of churches that operate independently. The SBC is known for its strong emphasis on the authority of the Bible, the autonomy of local churches, and the importance of evangelism and missions.\n\nHistory\nThe SBC was founded in 1845 in Augusta, Georgia, by a group of Baptists who sought to create a more unified and organized denomination. The convention was initially called the Southern Baptist Convention, but it was later renamed the Southern Baptist Convention in 1853. The SBC was formed in response to the growing influence of the Northern Baptist Convention, which was more liberal in its theology and practices. The SBC was also influenced by the rise of the fundamentalist movement in the early 20th century, which emphasized a return to traditional Baptist beliefs and practices.\n\nBeliefs\nThe SBC is a Baptist denomination, which means that it adheres to the Baptist faith and mission. Baptists believe in the autonomy of the local church, the authority of the Bible, and the importance of evangelism and missions. The SBC also emphasizes the importance of social justice and the need to address issues such as poverty, racism, and inequality.

The Latin word d\u0101ma or damma, used for roe deer, gazelles, and antelopes, lies at the root of the modern scientific name, as well as the German Damhirsch, French daim, Dutch damhert, and Italian daino. In Serbo-Croatian, the name for the fallow deer is jelen lopatar (\"shovel deer\"), due to the form of its antlers. The Modern Hebrew name of the fallow deer is yachmur (\u05d9\u05d7\u05de\u05d5\u05e8).\n\nTaxonomy and evolution\nThe genus includes two extant species:\n\nExtant species\nSome taxonomists classify the Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (D. d. mesopotamica), while others, such as the IUCN, treat it as a separate species (D. mesopotamica).\n\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about other areas that share a common deer species with the forests of Mara and Mondrem. From the passages provided, I need to find which deer species is associated with those forests and then see which other areas have that same species.\n\nLooking at Passage 5, it mentions the Forests of Mara and Mondrem in Cheshire, England. The passage states that these forests were hunting grounds for the Norman Earls of Chester and that the game included red, fallow, and roe deer. So the common deer species here are fallow deer, red deer, and roe deer. \n\nNow, the question is asking for other areas that share a common deer species with these forests. The key here is to find which of the other passages mention any of these species. \n\nLooking at Passage 1, it's entirely about fallow deer (Dama). The passage discusses their taxonomy, name, and distribution. Since the forests of Mara and Mondrem have fallow deer, any area that also has fallow deer would be a candidate. \n\nPassage 2 is about moose, which is a different species (Alces alces), so that's not relevant. \n\nPassage 3 is about white-bellied musk deer, which is a different species altogether. \n\nPassage 4 is about Sri Lankan sambar", "actual": ["New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the Falkland Islands, and Peru."]}
