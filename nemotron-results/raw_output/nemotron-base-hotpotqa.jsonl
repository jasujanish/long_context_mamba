It was the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space. It is the most distant human-made object from Earth. As of 2023, it is about 24.3 billion kilometers (15.1 billion miles) from Earth. It is traveling at a speed of about 17 kilometers per second (38,000 miles per hour) relative to the Sun. It is expected to exit the heliosphere and enter interstellar space in the 2030s.\nVoyager 1 was launched as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System. It was launched on September 5, 1977, 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. The two spacecraft were launched to take advantage of a favorable alignment of the outer planets. Voyager 1's trajectory took it to Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2's trajectory took it to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. After completing its primary mission, Voyager 1 continued on its trajectory, heading out of the Solar System. It is now in interstellar space, where it is studying the environment of the heliosphere and the interstellar medium.\nVoyager 1 carries a golden record containing sounds and images selected to represent life and culture on Earth. The record is intended to be a message to any extraterrestrial life that might find it. The record includes sounds of nature, music from various cultures, and a message from then-NASA administrator James E. Carter.\nVoyager 1's mission has provided valuable data about the outer Solar System and the interstellar medium. It has discovered new moons, studied the magnetic fields of planets, and measured the radiation environment in the outer Solar System. Its continued operation has allowed it to study the heliosphere and the interstellar medium, providing insights into the boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space.\nVoyager 1 is expected to continue operating until at least the 2030s, when its power supply is expected to be depleted.

The distinction lies in the specific species mentioned, but the question does not specify which species to compare. Given the information, both are correct, but the answer must choose one. The passages do not provide a basis to exclude either, so the answer should state both are flowering plants. However, the question format implies a single answer. Re-examining the passages, Pueraria is a genus of legumes (flowering plants), and Pleiospilos is explicitly called a flowering plant in multiple passages.

The SBC is known for its strong emphasis on the authority of the Bible, the autonomy of local churches, and the importance of evangelism and missions.\n\nHistory\nThe SBC was founded in 1845 in Augusta, Georgia, by a group of Baptists who sought to create a more unified and organized denomination. The convention was initially called the Southern Baptist Convention, but it was later renamed the Southern Baptist Convention in 1853. The SBC was formed in response to the growing influence of the Northern Baptist Convention, which was more liberal in its theology and practices. The SBC was also influenced by the rise of the fundamentalist movement in the early 20th century, which emphasized a return to traditional Baptist beliefs and practices.\n\nBeliefs\nThe SBC is a Baptist denomination, which means that it adheres to the Baptist faith and mission. Baptists believe in the autonomy of the local church, the authority of the Bible, and the importance of evangelism and missions. The SBC also emphasizes the importance of social justice and the need to address issues such as poverty, racism, and inequality.

The Latin word d\u0101ma or damma, used for roe deer, gazelles, and antelopes, lies at the root of the modern scientific name, as well as the German Damhirsch, French daim, Dutch damhert, and Italian daino. In Serbo-Croatian, the name for the fallow deer is jelen lopatar (\"shovel deer\"), due to the form of its antlers. The Modern Hebrew name of the fallow deer is yachmur (\u05d9\u05d7\u05de\u05d5\u05e8).\n\nTaxonomy and evolution\nThe genus includes two extant species:\n\nExtant species\nSome taxonomists classify the Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (D. d. mesopotamica), while others, such as the IUCN, treat it as a separate species (D. mesopotamica).\n\n\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about other areas that share a common deer species with the forests of Mara and Mondrem. From the passages provided, I need to find which deer species is associated with those forests and then see which other areas have that same species.\n\nLooking at Passage 5, it mentions the Forests of Mara and Mondrem in Cheshire, England. The passage states that these forests were hunting grounds for the Norman Earls of Chester and that the game included red, fallow, and roe deer. So the common deer species here are fallow deer, red deer, and roe deer. \n\nNow, the question is asking for other areas that share a common deer species with these forests. The key here is to find which of the other passages mention any of these species. \n\nLooking at Passage 1, it's entirely about fallow deer (Dama). The passage discusses their taxonomy, name, and distribution. Since the forests of Mara and Mondrem have fallow deer, any area that also has fallow deer would be a candidate. \n\nPassage 2 is about moose, which is a different species (Alces alces), so that's not relevant. \n\nPassage 3 is about white-bellied musk deer, which is a different species altogether. \n\nPassage 4 is about Sri Lankan sambar", "actual": ["New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the Falkland Islands, and Peru."]}

The album was a critical and commercial success, helping to revitalize the careers of Dylan, Orbison, and Petty.

When this collaboration, \"Handle with Care\", was deemed too good for such a limited release, the group agreed to record a full album. The album was recorded primarily over a ten-day period in May 1988, to allow for Dylan's limited availability as he prepared for the start of what became known as his Never Ending Tour and for Orbison's tour schedule. These sessions were held in the house of Eurythmics member Dave Stewart, in Los Angeles. The five band members sat in a circle playing acoustic guitars in Stewart's kitchen; once each song's basic track had been written and recorded there (with accompaniment from a drum machine), the group recorded their vocals in another room, usually after dinner each night. Petty recalled that, as a friend but also an avowed fan of Dylan's, Harrison felt the need to clear the air on the first day by saying to him: \"We know that you're Bob Dylan and everything, but we're going to just treat you and talk to you like we would anybody else.\" Dylan replied: \"Well, great.

The chassis was designed by Neil Oatley, Steve Nichols, Matthew Jeffreys, David North, David Neilson, Paddy Lowe and Henri Durand, with Mario Illien designing the bespoke Ilmor engine. It was driven by Finn Mika H\u00e4kkinen, who was in his fourth full season with the team, and Briton David Coulthard, who moved from Williams.\n\nOverview\nBackground\nMcLaren had endured a mostly disappointing season in 1996, with the MP4/11 beset by handling and reliability problems in the team's first year in partnership with Mercedes-Benz, although it did score two podiums and regular points. The second year of the arrangement was to be far more productive with both performance and reliability improved, but the team had yet to make the serious breakthrough necessary to challenge the \"big three\" of Williams, Ferrari and Benetton.\n\nPre-season testing\nIn pre-season testing, which took place at Estoril in February 1997 and Silverstone in March, four-times world champion Alain Prost was brought in as a technical advisor to test-drive the MP4/12 in H\u00e4kkinen's absence, who was still recovering from his near-fatal crash during qualifying for the 1995 Australian Grand Prix.\n\nRacing history\nThe car's best result came in Monaco, with Coulthard finishing a close second to Olivier Panis' Ligier at the end of a chaotic race. However, Coulthard was outscored and generally outpaced by his teammate.\nThe car was developed throughout the season, with improvements initiated to eradicate an initial handling imbalance in time for Coulthard to lead the first 19 laps in San Marino.  On the MP4/11, a small additional wing was mounted on the engine cover, but this was removed in mid-1995.  The wing was brought back for the MP4/12 in Monaco, and was also used at Hungary.  A \"B\" version of the chassis was developed for Silverstone, and H\u00e4kkinen responded with four podium finishes from then until the end of the season.\n1997 was also notable for McLaren losing its long-term Marlboro sponsorship at the end", "actual": ["Mika H\u00e4kkinen"]}

It is located on Route 43, south of Crystal Lake and east of West Sand Lake.\nThe Sand Lake Baptist Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.\n\nDemographics\nHistory\nOriginally known only as part of greater Sand Lake, the community along with neighboring towns grew with the nineteenth-century development of wool and cotton textile manufacturing by local watermills and knitting factories along the Wynants Kill tributary of the Hudson River. By the 1880s, several independent local mills produced hosiery, undergarments, and knit shirts.The hamlet was named Averill in 1880 after a local leading family, then in 1882 renamed Averill Park in promotion of local summer-resort development and of the Troy & New England Railway, a never-completed trolley and freight line intended to connect the city of Troy, New York with the mills and summer resorts of Averill Park and its \u201cupstate Coney Island\u201d recreational Crystal Lake Beach, and with the mills of the neighboring town of West Sand Lake.The local mills declined after the increasing efficiency of steam and electrical power improved competition from regional factories, and were then destroyed by a 1891 river flood. The Faith Knitting Company (later Faith Mills), founded in 1897, restored local industry by buying and re-equipping the old mills and rehiring local labor. Other late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century firms included Jake Warger\u2019s Dry Goods Store; Gilbert Beebe\u2019s blacksmith shop; Stout\u2019s Hardware; and Park Pharmacy, where Jerry Lewis worked as a soda jerk in 1942 when his father was a superintendent at Faith Mills.Mid-nineteenth- to early twentieth-century seasonal hotels included Al\u2019s Place, Hilke\u2019s Averill Park Hotel (previously housing Scram\u2019s Collegiate Institute), Traveler\u2019s Rest (aka Sand Lake House, Tillotson\u2019s Hotel,", "actual": ["1,693"]}

The mine was developed by the Canadian Gold Mines Limited, a subsidiary of the Canadian Gold Mines Corporation. The mine was named after the Negus River, which flows nearby. The mine was opened in 1939 and operated until 1952. The mine was closed due to low gold prices and high operating costs.

The town runs from the west to the east border of the county in its northern section. The population was 39,087 at the 2020 census. The name comes from the Dutch word Haverstroo meaning \"oats straw\", referring to the grasslands along the river. The town contains three villages, one of which is also known as Haverstraw. Haverstraw village is the original seat of government for the town, hosting the area's historic central downtown business district and the densest population in northern Rockland County.\n\nHistory\nIn 1609, the region was explored by Henry Hudson. A land purchase was made in this town in 1666 from local natives and confirmed as a patent in 1671.  The region was known as Haverstroo, meaning \"oat straw\" in Dutch.\nDuring the American Revolution, it served as an important lookout for British activities on the Hudson. A blue-marked trail, the Long Path, may be taken 2 miles (3 km) eastward from Central Highway along the crest of South Mountain to High Tor. Halfway is Little Tor, the second highest peak on South Mountain.\nThe town of Haverstraw was formed in 1788 while still part of Orange County, New York.  Haverstraw was partitioned in 1791 to form the town of Clarkstown and the town of Ramapo and again in 1865 to form the town of Stony Point.\nIn 1826 the town was the site of a short-lived effort to establish an Owenite colony called the Franklin Community. Underfinanced and wracked by internal dissent, the model Owenite community folded after a mere five months of operation.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 27.4 square miles (71.0 km2), of which 22.2 square miles (57.4 km2) is land and 5.3 square miles (13", "actual": ["810"]}

Since annexation, Hawaii's white-dominated oligarchy comprised three branches: the HSPA and Big Five sugar plantations dominated economics, the Republican Party dominated politics, and the white minority dominated society. These organs supported each other: one important example was that the plantations were a crucial source of Republican votes.

While several workers had the right to vote, they valued their livelihood more than their right to choose their candidate.:\u200a76\u200aRacism was not only a social issue but more importantly an economic one.

McCarthy for racial segregation to prevent their children for being exposed to what they believed to be the \"corrupting influences\" of the colored students. McCarthy had little sympathy for the immigrant Asian population and agreed to create English Standard Schools for whites and some Hawaiians, who were given privileges over students attending the more prevalent public schools.

The program was run by the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps and was authorized by President Harry S. Truman. The program was designed to bring German scientists to the United States to work on the development of the American space program. The program was named after the code name for the operation, \"Paperclip,\" which was used to refer to the operation in the early stages.\n\nBackground\nAfter World War II, the United States was interested in recruiting German scientists to help with the development of the American space program. The U.S. government was aware that many German scientists had worked on the V-2 rocket program for Nazi Germany. The U.S. government believed that these scientists could be valuable assets to the American space program.\n\nRecruitment\nThe U.S. government recruited German scientists through a variety of means. Some scientists were recruited through the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps, while others were recruited through the U.S. Department of State. The U.S. government also used the help of former Nazi officials to recruit scientists.\n\nOperation\nThe operation was carried out in secret. The U.S. government did not want to publicize the fact that they were recruiting German scientists. The operation was carried out by the U.S. Army's Intelligence Corps, which was responsible for recruiting and bringing the scientists to the United States.\n\nResults\nThe operation was successful. Many of the German scientists recruited through Operation Paperclip went on to work on the American space program. Some of the most notable scientists recruited through the operation include Wernher von Braun, who worked on the development of the V-2 rocket and later the Saturn V rocket, and Walter Dornberger, who worked on the development of the V-2 rocket.\n\nLegacy\nOperation Paperclip is considered to be a successful operation. It helped the United States to develop its space program and led to the development of the Saturn V rocket, which was used to land astronauts on the Moon. The operation is also considered to be a controversial one, as it involved the recruitment of former Nazi scientists.\n\nSee also\nOperation Highjump\nOperation Highjump\nOperation Highjump was a United States military operation during World War II.

The male of the species is sometimes referred to as a roebuck. The roe is a small deer, reddish and grey-brown, and well-adapted to cold environments. The species is widespread in Europe, from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia, from Scotland to the Caucasus, and east as far as northern Iran.\n\nEtymology\nThe English roe is from the Old English r\u0101 or r\u0101ha, from Proto-Germanic *raih\u00f4, cognate with Old Norse r\u00e1, Old Saxon r\u0113ho, Middle Dutch and Dutch ree, Old High German r\u0113h, r\u0113ho, r\u0113ia, German Reh. It is perhaps ultimately derived from a PIE root *rei-, meaning \"streaked, spotted or striped\".The word is attested on the 5th-century Caistor-by-Norwich astragalus \u2013 a roe deer talus bone, written in Elder Futhark as \u16b1\u16a8\u16c7\u16ba\u16a8\u16be, transliterated as ra\u00efhan.In the English language, this deer was originally simply called a 'roe', but over time the word 'roe' has become a qualifier, and it is now usually called 'roe deer'.The Koin\u00e9 Greek name \u03c0\u03cd\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2, transliterated 'pygargos', mentioned in the Septuagint and the works of various writers such as Hesychius, Herodotus and later Pliny, was originally thought to refer to this species (in many European translations of the Bible), although it is now more often believed to refer to the addax. It is derived from the words pyge 'buttocks' and argo 'white'.\nThe taxonomic name Capreolus is derived from capra or caprea, meaning 'billy goat', with the diminutive suffix -olus. The meaning of this word in Latin is not entirely clear: it may have meant 'ibex' or 'chamois'. The roe was also known as capraginus or capruginus in Latin.\n\nTaxonomy\nLinnaeus first described the roe deer in the modern taxonomic system as Cervus capreolus in 1758.

The game was published by Broderbund in the United States, Playtoy Industries in Canada, and Parker Brothers International in Britain.\nAn updated version by the original creator was launched on Kickstarter on May 1, 2023. The new version contains updated cultural references and new categories.\n\nOriginal 1987 Version\nThe game contains cards in four categories: Food & Drink, Activities, People, and Potpourri (miscellaneous). Each card has a photo or drawing on each side and text indicating what that side represents (e.g., chocolate \u00e9clairs, climbing a mountain, Harrison Ford, spy novels). Each round, one player draws four cards from one category, or one from each category, depending on the player's position on the board. Each card is placed in a colored quadrant of the board. The player then ranks these four items according to his or her preference using color-coded cards that are placed in an envelope.

It is the AM counterpart to WAMC-FM (90.3 FM), which is the primary station of the WAMC network. WAMC (AM) is owned by \"WAMC Northeast Public Radio\", a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. The station's primary signal covers the Capital District, with a secondary signal covering parts of eastern New York, southern Vermont, Western Massachusetts, and the Litchfield Hills region. The station is also heard in parts of New Hampshire, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey via a network of repeaters. WAMC (AM) is a member of National Public Radio (NPR) and American Public Media.\n\nHistory\nWAMC (AM) signed on the air in October 1958. It was the first station to broadcast on 1400 AM in Albany. The station was put on the air by the local hospital and medical school, Albany Medical Center and Albany Medical College. The affiliation with Albany Medical College was the source of the call sign WAMC. In 1981, the station became an independent institution, no longer associated with the medical school.\nIn its early days, WAMC had a mostly classical music radio format. The earliest years also included broadcasts of health information and lectures from visiting medical professors. Early on, part of WAMC's regular programming was the broadcast of live concerts by the Boston Symphony Orchestra from Tanglewood and Boston. When the NPR network was founded in 1970, WAMC signed on as one of NPR's original 90 \"charter\" members.\n\nSeparating from the medical school\nAround 1980, financial pressures caused the hospital and medical school to begin divesting the station. In 1981, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) license on 1400 AM was transferred to a 501c3 tax-exempt entity, WAMC, Inc., which had been set up by a group of five corporators, including the current CEO and president, Alan S. Chartock. WAMC was initially affiliated with the State University of New York and New York State government.\nIn the years since the transfer, the station has eliminated classical music", "actual": ["WAMC"]}

The reef structure is built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It is regarded as one of the world's seven natural wonders. The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia. The reef is so large that it can be seen from outer space and it is the world's largest structure made by living organisms. It is also one of the most diverse places on Earth, with over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, and 4,000 species of molluscs. The reef is also home to many other species, including sea turtles, sharks, and dolphins. The Great Barrier Reef is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is considered to be one of the most important natural treasures in the world.

It is often found in association with other pioneer species such as Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis glandulosa.\n\nUses\nThe plant is used as a source of fodder for livestock. The seeds are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The wood is used for fuel and construction. The bark is used for tanning and as a dye.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks whether Mimosa or Cryptocoryne is a shrub. To answer this, I need to examine the provided passages for descriptions of each. \n\nFor Mimosa, multiple passages (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) describe various Mimosa species as shrubs. For example, Passage 1 states Mimosa is a genus of \"herbs and shrubs,\" and Passage 2 specifically describes Mimosa somnians as a \"woody shrub.\" Similarly, Passage 3 refers to Mimosa turneri as a \"small- to medium-sized shrub,\" and Passage 10 describes Mimosa texana as a \"shrub.\" These consistent references confirm Mimosa includes shrub species.\n\nIn contrast, Passage 8 exclusively describes Cryptocoryne as aquatic plants, noting they grow in streams, rivers, and flooded areas. There is no mention of Cryptocoryne being a shrub. The term \"shrub\" is not used in any passage related to Cryptocoryne, and their described habitats and growth forms (e.g., submerged, emersed) do not align with shrub characteristics.\n\nThus, based on the passages, Mimosa includes shrub species, while Cryptocoryne does not.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMimosa is a shrub, as multiple passages describe various Mimosa species as shrubs (e.g., Passage 1: \"Mimosa is a genus of about 590 species of herbs and shrubs\" [Title 1]; Passage 2: \"Mimosa somnians is a species of woody shrub\" [Title 2]; Passage 3: \"Mimosa turn", "actual": ["Mimosa"]}

In most countries, a research degree qualifies the holder to teach at university level in the degree's field or work in a specific profession. There are a number of doctoral degrees; the most common is the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), awarded in many different fields, ranging from the humanities to scientific disciplines.\nIn the United States and some other countries, there are also professional degrees that include \"doctor\" in their name and are classified as doctorates. \nMany universities also award honorary doctorates to individuals deemed worthy of special recognition, either for scholarly work or  other contributions to the university or society.\n\nHistory\nMiddle Ages\nThe term doctor derives from Latin, meaning \"teacher\" or \"instructor\". The doctorate (Latin: doctoratus) appeared in medieval Europe as a license to teach Latin (licentia docendi) at a university. Its roots can be traced to the early church in which the term doctor referred to the Apostles, church fathers, and other Christian authorities who taught and interpreted the Bible.The right to grant a licentia docendi (i.e. the doctorate) was originally reserved to the Catholic Church, which required the applicant to pass a test, take an oath of allegiance, and pay a fee. The Third Council of the Lateran of 1179 guaranteed access\u2014at that time essentially free of charge\u2014to all able applicants. Applicants were tested for aptitude. This right remained a bone of contention between the church authorities and the universities, slowly distancing themselves from the Church. In 121", "actual": ["University"]}

The book is a semi-autobiographical account detailing 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons and anecdotes from historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Sun Tzu, Socrates, Napoleon, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin.\n\nOrigins\nThe 50th Law grew out of the friendship and mutual admiration between 50 Cent and Robert Greene. Greene's book The 48 Laws of Power, which has long been a staple in the hip hop world, came to the attention of 50 Cent, who asked his manager to arrange a meeting. Greene said that he was surprised by 50 Cent's persona and was impressed by his \"Zen-like calmness\" and eye for strategy.

It is a rare example of a hybrid pony truss that is similar to the 19th century truss design of Simeon S. Post. It was built by J. H. Cofrode & Co. of Philadelphia in 1870. It was the first iron bridge to be constructed in the town. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.\nThe bridge formerly carried Bolton Road, but was closed to vehicular traffic in 1975 and bypassed by a modern highway bridge in the 1980s.\nThe bridge remained open to pedestrian traffic until April 2020, when a flash flood damaged the bridge's wooden deck and it was closed to all traffic. The long-term future of the bridge is uncertain.\nThe sign commemorating Atherton Bridge states:\n\n ATHERTON BRIDGE\nThere has been a bridge at this location since early settlement. It is named for \nJames Atherton, one of the signers of the petition for incorporation of the town in 1652. The 1794 map lists the bridge as 90 feet long on a county way Lancaster\u2019s first iron bridge was placed here in 1870.\n\nTechnical information\nThe Atherton Bridge has iron compression posts that incline inward towards the center of the span and diagonal tension rods that incline outward towards the abutments. Unusual features include double end posts with adjustable turnbuckles, channeled castings to join the lower chord bars, and patented Phoenix columns for all inclined posts. This bridge does not make use of Simeon Post's patented joints. The floor beams support a wood plank deck.\nThe bridge is 72 feet (22 m) long and 18.5 feet (5.6 m) feet wide, and is composed of eight panels. It rests on granite abutments.\nThe bridge was photographed in 1979 by Jet Lowe of the Historic American Engineering Record, and documented in 1990 as part of the Massachusetts Historic Bridge Project.
