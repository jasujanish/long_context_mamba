The newborn prince was baptised the same evening with the name Christian by the royal confessor Hans Leth. His grandfather King Frederick III had died a year and a half before he was born, and as the eldest son of the ruling King he was thus Crown Prince from birth. At the age of 18, he was given a seat on the Council of State as the heir apparent to the throne.\nAs Crown Prince, Christian broadened his education by travelling in Europe, led by his chamberlain Ditlev Wibe. He was particularly impressed by the architecture in Italy and, on his return to Denmark, asked his father for permission to build a summer palace on Solbjerg, as the hill in Valby was then known, the future site of Frederiksberg Palace. The one-storey building, probably designed by Ernst Brandenburger, was completed in 1703.\nChristian was allowed to choose his future wife from a number of Protestant royal daughters in northern Germany.

A cautious and thoughtful politician, he aimed for peace and reconciliation in the Empire.

The rebellion was ultimately unsuccessful, and Saig\u014d was killed in battle.\n\nLegacy\nSaig\u014d is considered a hero in Japan for his role in the Meiji Restoration and his opposition to the Meiji government's modernization policies. He is also considered a traitor for leading the Satsuma Rebellion.

He was trained in the arts of war and leadership. He was also taught the importance of unity and the need to protect the Hawaiian people from foreign invaders. Kamehameha's early life was marked by a series of conflicts with other Hawaiian chiefs, but he managed to maintain his position as a respected leader.\n\nUnification of the Hawaiian Islands\nKamehameha's most significant achievement was the unification of the Hawaiian Islands.

She was a daughter of Charles I, Duke of Bourbon and Agnes of Burgundy, and the mother of Mary of Burgundy, heiress of Burgundy.\n\nLife\nNot much is known about Isabella's life. She was the daughter of the reigning Duke of Bourbon, and his Burgundian wife, Agnes, daughter of John the Fearless, the powerful Duke of Burgundy.\nAlthough her father was politically opposed to his brother-in-law, Philip the Good, he betrothed Isabella to Charles the Bold, only legitimate son and heir of Burgundy as a condition of truce. She married Charles on 30 October 1454 at Lille, France, and they were reportedly very much in love, perhaps because of (or causing) her husband's faithfulness.In 1459, Isabella stood godmother to Joachim, the short-lived son of the refugee Dauphin of France and his second wife, Charlotte of Savoy. Upon his succession to the throne of France, the Dauphin abandoned his wife in Burgundy, leaving the young Queen Charlotte dependent on Isabella's aid.\nAfter several months of illness, Isabella died of tuberculosis in Antwerp aged 31.\n\nTomb\nIsabella's early death meant that she had little significance or influence during her lifetime, but in death she became a symbol of the power of the Dukes of Burgundy, which would later be inherited by her only daughter Mary. As the duke's second marriage failed to produce a son, Mary was heiress to the duchy, and her marriage to a Habsburg had major repercussions for centuries.\n\nIsabella's funeral monument was built in the church of St. Michael's Abbey, Antwerp in 1476. It was decorated with 24 brass copper alloy statuettes of noblemen and women standing in niches, now known as 'weepers' or 'mourners', placed above a bronze effigy of Isabella.

This indicates she has dual Chinese and German nationality. \n\n- Johann Christian Gustav Lucae is detailed in Passage 7 as a German anatomist born in Frankfurt am Main and active in Germany. There is no mention of any other nationality for him. \n\nSince Ding Yaping has both Chinese and German nationality, and Johann Christian Gustav Lucae is solely German, they share the German nationality. However, Ding Yaping's additional Chinese nationality means they are not exclusively of the same nationality. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether \"same nationality\" requires identical nationalities or shared nationality. Given the phrasing, the key is that both have German nationality, but Ding Yaping's dual nationality complicates a strict \"same\" claim. However, based on the passages, the direct comparison shows they both have German nationality, which could be interpreted as sharing that nationality. Yet, since Ding Yaping is also Chinese, the answer must reflect that they are not exclusively of the same nationality. \n\nHowever, the passages do not explicitly state that Johann Christian Gustav Lucae has any nationality other than German, and Ding Yaping is listed as both Chinese and German.

From the provided passages:\n\nLooking at Passage 1, \"Traces of Smoke\" (which I think is the same as \"Tiger in the Smoke\" since the title might be a translation or alternative name) is directed by Frans van de Staak. The passage mentions it's a 1992 film. \n\nThen, Passage 2 is about \"Contragolpe\", directed by Alejandro Doria. The passage states he was born in 1936 and died on June 17, 2009. \n\nNow, checking the other passages for more info. Passage 6 also mentions Alejandro Doria, confirming his death date. \n\nFor \"Tiger in the Smoke\", Passage 7 says it's directed by Roy Ward Baker, who died on October 5, 2010. \n\nSo, comparing the death dates: Alejandro Doria died in 2009, and Roy Ward Baker in 2010. Therefore, Doria died earlier. \n\nThe question is which film's director died earlier. Since Contragolpe's director (Doria) died in 2009 and Tiger in the Smoke's director (Baker) in 2010, Contragolpe's director died earlier. \n\nI should make sure there's no other director mentioned.

Thus, Philippe, Duke of Nemours is Jacques's father, making him Henri I's paternal grandfather. Since Henri II is Henri I's son (as per Passage 3), Philippe, Duke of Nemours is also Henri II's paternal grandfather.

He is also mentioned in the Grove Music Online.\nPassage 11:\nGretchen am Spinnrade\n\"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" (Gretchen at the Spinning Wheel), Op. 2, D 118, is a Lied composed by Franz Schubert using the text from Part One, scene 15 of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's Faust. With \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" and some 600 other songs for voice and piano, Schubert contributed transformatively to the genre of Lied. \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" was composed for soprano voice but has been transposed to accommodate other voice types. Schubert composed \"Gretchen am Spinnrade\" on 19 October 1814, three months before his eighteenth birthday.\n\nGerman text\nAnalysis\nThe song is in three sections, exactly reflecting the form of Goethe's poem. On the other hand, Schubert contradicts Gretchen's return to composure in the last three stanzas by obsessively repeating her words to create a second climax on the highest note of the song.The song opens with Gretchen at her spinning wheel, thinking of Faust and all that he had promised. The accompaniment in the right hand mimics the perpetual movement of the spinning-wheel and the left hand imitates the foot treadle. The initial key of D minor sets a longing tone as Gretchen begins to sing of her heartache (\"Meine Ruh' ist hin/Mein herz ist schwer\"). The first section progresses from D minor to C major, A minor, E minor, F major, and then returns to D minor. This, plus the crescendo, builds tension which releases only to be brought back to the beginning, much like the ever-circling spinning wheel. The song modulates to F major as Gretchen starts talking of Faust (\"Sein hoher Gang/Sein' edle Gestalt\"). The left-hand imitation of the treadle disappears and changes to block chords. Additionally, the absence of the rhythmic, consistent treadle allows Gretchen to lose her sense of stability and reality as she swoons over Faust.

The user is asking who was born later between Hugh Evelyn Wortham and Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m. \n\nFirst, I need to find the birth dates of both individuals from the provided passages. Let me start by scanning through each passage to locate their birth information.\n\nLooking at Passage 1 for Hugh Evelyn Wortham: It says he was born on 7 May 1884. That's clear. \n\nNow, for Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m, I need to check the passages. Scanning through, I see Passage 9 mentions Johnny Douglas Ekstr\u00f6m was born on 5 March 1965. \n\nSo, comparing the two birth dates: 1884 vs. 1965. Obviously, 1965 is much later than 1884. Therefore, Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m was born later. \n\nWait, but I should double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any names. The question specifies Hugh Evelyn Wortham and Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m. The passages have Hugh Evelyn Wortham in Passage 1 with 1884, and Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m in Passage 9 with 1965. No other Johnny in the passages seems relevant here. \n\nAnother thing to confirm: sometimes there might be multiple people with similar names, but in this case, the passages are distinct. Hugh Evelyn Wortham is an English biographer born in 1884, and Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m is a Swedish footballer born in 1965. \n\nSo the answer should be Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m was born later. The key passages are Passage 1 for Wortham's birth date and Passage 9 for Ekstr\u00f6m's.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe birth dates of the two individuals are provided in the passages. Hugh Evelyn Wortham was born on 7 May 1884 (Passage 1). Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m was born on 5 March 1965", "actual": ["Johnny Ekstr\u00f6m"]}
