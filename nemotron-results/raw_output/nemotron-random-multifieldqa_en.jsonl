Data are expressed as fold change vs. control (w/o HisOH = 1, top; control siRNA = 1, bottom). *P<0.05 (one way ANOVA, followed by Tukey\u2019s post-test; P values refer to comparisons vs. control, unless otherwise indicated).\nTo further investigate the role of GCN2 in the response to EAA starvation, we tested whether the reactivation of the transgene is affected by the inhibition of GCN2 activity. To this aim, we used the compound ISRIB, which inhibits the activation of the ISR, even in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1, likely by boosting the activity of the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for eIF2\u03b1, namely eIF2B [53, 54]. HepG2-OA1 cells were stimulated with L-Histidinol, either in the presence or absence of ISRIB. As shown in Fig 8, while the expression of CHOP is inhibited by ISRIB, as expected, the reactivation of the OA1 transgene is not affected. In addition, knockdown of the closest eIF2\u03b1 downstream effector ATF4 by siRNAs does not interfere with the reactivation of the OA1 transgene by L-Histidinol (Fig 8). Together, these data strongly support the conclusion that GCN2 is not necessary for transgene reactivation in response to EAA starvation, either in HeLa or in HepG2 cells.\nTo further investigate the role of GCN2 in the response to EAA starvation, we tested whether the reactivation of the transgene is affected by the inhibition of GCN2 activity.

{"input": "What experimental techniques were used to study the quantum dot structures in this research?", "predicted": "\\bibliographystyle{unsrt}\n\\bibliography{references}\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe experimental techniques used to study the quantum dot structures in this research are detailed in the \"Experimental section\" and \"Results and discussion\" sections of the provided passages. Specifically, the experiments involved the use of low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to probe the quantum dots. The STM/STS technique is described in the Experimental section, where it is mentioned that the experiments were performed in a commercial low-temperature STM setup operating at approximately 5 K in ultra-high vacuum. The STM/STS method was used to record topography images and differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra, which were then analyzed to obtain local density of states (LDOS) maps. These LDOS maps were crucial for identifying the quantum dot structures and their properties.\n\nAdditionally, the Results and discussion section provides further details on how the STM/STS data was interpreted. For instance, the LDOS patterns were analyzed to reveal discrete states in the conduction and valence bands, which are indicative of quantum confinement. The spatial resolution of the STM/STS technique (approximately 0.2-0.3 nm) allowed for the precise localization of defect sites and the observation of quantized states with level spacings of the order of 100 meV or larger. The use of STM/STS is further supported by the fact that the experiments were conducted at cryogenic temperatures, which is necessary to observe such small energy scales.\n\nThe ab-initio calculations and piecewise constant potential model mentioned in the Results and discussion section are computational techniques used to complement the experimental STM/STS data. However, the primary experimental technique used to directly study the quantum dot structures is STM/STS.\n\nTherefore, the experimental technique used in this research is low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS).\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe experimental technique used to study the quantum dot structures in this research is low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) [Experimental section].\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["Low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS)."]}

{"input": "What size chains were used in the benchmarking?", "predicted": " of the main text. We consider a periodic L = 14 Heisenberg chain with PBC, affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. The denoiser is affected by the same noise. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0 and the noiseless results with p = 0.\nThe panels are arranged as Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 for top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively. We see that the denoiser allows us to recover the noiseless behavior. The domain wall magnetization Z dw is defined as the expectation value of the operator Z dw = 1/L \u2211 i=1 L Z i Z i+1 , where the indices are taken modulo L. This operator is sensitive to the presence of domain walls in the system, and its expectation value is zero for a uniform magnetization.\nThe domain wall magnetization is a useful observable to test the denoiser because it is a local observable that is sensitive to the presence of domain walls, which are not present in the noiseless case. The fact that the denoiser can recover the noiseless behavior of Z dw indicates that it is able to mitigate the noise effectively.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks about the size of chains used in benchmarking.

{"input": "How does the transition probability of the environment affect the learning rate in the static agent?", "predicted": " The work presented here is a first step towards understanding how environmental variability shapes the evolution of learning mechanisms in embodied agents.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe passage discusses how environmental variability, specifically the distance between environments (d_e) and the transition probability (p_tr), affects the learning rate (\u03b7_p) in both static and embodied agents. For static agents, the learning rate increases with d_e (greater environmental distance requires faster learning) and decreases with p_tr (higher transition probability reduces learning rate). The embodied agents show similar trends but with nuances due to their motor network interaction. The key passage is [Environmental variability and network structure determine the optimal plasticity mechanisms in embodied agents], which explicitly links environmental parameters to learning rate evolution.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe transition probability of the environment (p_tr) inversely affects the learning rate (\u03b7_p) in both static and embodied agents. As p_tr increases, \u03b7_p decreases, meaning faster environmental changes lead to slower learning rates. This is because agents adapt to frequent changes by reducing plasticity to avoid instability.

Future work could explore more robust methods for constructing the hyperplane arrangement that are less sensitive to the geometry of the environment.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe main advantage of the proposed method in terms of computation time is that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment. This is explicitly stated in the abstract and further supported in the experiments section. The abstract notes: \"We find that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment, which makes our method suitable for online applications.\" Additionally, in the experiments, the computation time for the Path Preference method is evaluated across maps of varying complexity (Map 1, Map 2, Map 3), and the results show no significant increase in computation time despite the increase in the number of polytopes and obstacles. This indicates that the method maintains efficient computation regardless of environmental complexity.\n\nThe key factor enabling this efficiency is the encoding of path preference using a partitioning of the environment into polytopes and the use of conditional independence assumptions. These assumptions reduce the number of computations required during Bayesian updates, as explained in the \"Inference\" section. Specifically, the conditional independence assumption allows the robot to update its belief over the goal and path preference with a complexity that does not scale exponentially with the number of obstacles or polytopes.\n\nThus, the primary advantage is the constant computation time for belief updates, even as the environment becomes more complex.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe main advantage of the proposed method in terms of computation time is that the time required to update the robot's belief does not increase with the complexity of the environment.

But now that I\u2019ve graduated seminary I sometimes have the honor of preaching. And as someone who just barely passed the two required preaching courses while he was focused on other things, I\u2019ve had to go back and really develop a theology and strategy of preaching. It should go without saying that it\u2019s a work in progress, but I\u2019m at a place now where I\u2019m comfortable with my system\u2014which means the next step is to share it. Maybe someone out there can benefit from what I\u2019ve learned, but either way there\u2019s always room for improvement and maybe you can help me see where.\nTopic/Text Selection\nThe first and most obvious question is what to preach on. I was trained to be sensitive to what the congregation needs to hear, but not being a pastor I don\u2019t have that kind of insight. I once heard John Piper say when he\u2019s a guest preacher he preaches to himself that way he knows at least one person needed it. I like that better, but this early in my ministry I\u2019ve taken to something a little less holy: what can I preach well?\nThis has really driven most of my sermons to-date, especially because I usually have only a few weeks\u2019 notice. I preached on Ahab because I had just read about him in my devotions. I preached on the tree and its fruits because I had just studied the passage in the context of LGBT acceptance. Most recently, I preached on 1 Corinthians because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been studying in Sunday School. The more I know something ahead of time, the better chance I have of knowing what to look for and how to communicate it.\nOnce I have my topic, I start running the passage through a system in the three phases we used in seminary: exegetical, theological, and homiletical.\nPhase 1: Exegetical\nThe exegetical phase is just getting into the passage itself. First, I want to know the immediate context for the passage. Why is this here? What ideas are continuing, and which are new? How the author frames the passage is probably the most important factor in choosing how I will introduce it in the sermon. If it\u2019s an epistle, I will also play with a structural outline to try and identify rhetorical choices.\nSecond,", "actual": ["The three phases are exegetical, theological, and homiletical."]}

Second, the preference for publishing data within journal articles rather than in open repositories or supplementary materials limits accessibility, as many journals do not require or incentivize the sharing of primary datasets (Lodwick 2019). Third, the absence of standardized data repositories or policies in many journals results in inconsistent data sharing practices, with only a minority of articles providing downloadable datasets (Lodwick 2019).

Specifically, in the \"Effect of Receptive Field Size\" section, it states that larger receptive field sizes enable the model to reconstruct shapes with bigger gaps more successfully. This is directly supported by the table referenced in the text, which shows a correlation between increased receptive field size and improved performance in filling gaps.

{"input": "What is the significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability?", "predicted": " The interlayer BCP G is defined as the Berry connection between the two layers, which is a measure of the interlayer hybridization. It is zero when the two layers are fully polarized, and reaches its maximum when the two layers are equally hybridized.\nThe BCP G is a pseudovector, and its curl [\u2202 k \u00d7 G] z is a pseudoscalar. The latter is the quantity that determines the intrinsic Hall response. The BCP G is nonzero only in the regions where the two layers are hybridized, and its magnitude is proportional to the degree of hybridization. The curl [\u2202 k \u00d7 G] z is nonzero only in the regions where the BCP G has a non-zero component in the k direction, which is the case when the BCP G has a non-zero component in the k direction.\nThe BCP G is a function of the twist angle \u03b8, and its magnitude and direction depend on the twist angle. The BCP G is zero at the magic angle, and reaches its maximum at the commensurate twist angles. The BCP G is also a function of the energy, and its magnitude and direction depend on the energy. The BCP G is a key quantity that determines the intrinsic Hall response, and its properties are crucial for understanding the effect.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe significance of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability (BCP) lies in its role as the geometric origin of the intrinsic Hall response in twisted bilayers. The paper explicitly states that the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect arises from the \"momentum space curl of interlayer Berry connection polarizability\" (Eq. ( ) and text). This quantity, denoted as \u03c7_int, measures the k-space curl of the interlayer BCP over occupied states and is a pseudoscalar invariant under rotation but flips sign under spatial inversion. Its non-zero value in chiral systems like twisted bilayers enables the intrinsic Hall current, which is controlled by the phase difference of orthogonal in-plane and out-of-plane fields. The BCP's dependence on interlayer hybridization further ties its significance to the unique electronic structure of twisted materials, allowing tunable rectification and frequency doubling. Thus, the interlayer BCP polarizability is central to the effect's mechanism and functionality.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe interlayer Berry connection polarizability is significant because it provides the geometric origin of the intrinsic Hall response in twisted bilayers. This is explicitly stated in the paper: \"The effect arises from the interlayer hybridization", "actual": ["The momentum space curl of the interlayer Berry connection polarizability generates the crossed nonlinear dynamical Hall effect."]}
{"input": "Can the denoiser be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise?", "predicted": " of the main text. We consider a periodic L = 14 Heisenberg chain with PBC, affected by two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01, which also affects the denoiser. The non-denoised results are labelled with M = 0 and the noiseless results with p = 0.\nThe panels are arranged as Mtrot = 8, 16, 32, 64 for top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right, respectively. We see that the denoiser allows us to recover the noiseless behavior. The denoiser is able to recover the noiseless behavior even for large noise strengths p, as shown in the Supplementary Material. This is due to the fact that the denoiser is able to invert the global noise channel, which is non-unitary, and thus can correct for the accumulated noise.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks whether the denoiser can be applied to circuits with non-Clifford noise. The provided passages explicitly state that the denoiser is designed to handle non-Clifford local noise channels. For instance, the abstract mentions that the approach \"works for non-Clifford local noise channels since the inversion of the accumulated global noise channel is implicit.\" Additionally, the results section confirms that the denoiser effectively mitigates errors for non-Clifford noise, such as two-qubit depolarizing noise with p = 0.01. The denoiser's ability to recover noiseless eigenvalues and entanglement entropy further supports its applicability to non-Clifford noise.

{"input": "What are the benefits of using binary variables in the SLAS formulation?", "predicted": " \n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe benefits of using binary variables in the SLAS formulation are discussed in the \"Computational Complexity Reduction\" section of the paper. The key points are:\n\n1. **Reduction of Computational Complexity**: The original formulation uses integer variables for lane changes, leading to a mixed-integer optimization problem with high computational complexity. By reformulating the problem with binary variables (e.g., Lk(i,j) representing lane choices), the problem becomes more tractable, reducing computation time significantly (e.g., from ~2s to ~0.096s per step).\n\n2. **Efficient Solving**: Binary variables allow the use of linear programming techniques instead of mixed-integer methods, which are computationally intensive. This is achieved through constraints like (21) and (22), which restrict lane changes to adjacent lanes and available lanes, respectively.\n\n3. **Lazy Constraints**: The paper mentions a lazy implementation of lane-changing constraints, which further enhances efficiency by deferring the enforcement of certain constraints until necessary, reducing the number of constraints processed during optimization.\n\nThese modifications collectively improve computational efficiency while maintaining safety and optimality guarantees.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe benefits of using binary variables in the SLAS formulation include reducing computational complexity by reformulating the problem with binary variables instead of integers, enabling more efficient linear programming techniques, and improving real-time performance through lazy constraint implementation.

{"input": "How are smartphones and tablets different from a technical perspective?", "predicted": " They could be a contender.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe passage discusses the technical differences between smartphones and tablets. Smartphones are described as more compact and power-constrained, with SoCs limited to around 1W due to battery and thermal limitations. They require integrated cellular modems for connectivity, and their software ecosystems are controlled by carriers, creating a walled-garden model. In contrast, tablets have higher power budgets (up to 4-8W), use Wi-Fi as the default connectivity, and lack cellular modems, making them more PC-like in design and usage. The text emphasizes that these distinctions will likely become more pronounced as markets evolve, with SoCs bifurcating to cater to each market's specific needs. The passage does not mention any technical differences related to memory integration or 3D packaging, which are raised in other comments but not in the provided text.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe technical differences between smartphones and tablets include power constraints (smartphones limited to ~1W vs. tablets up to 4-8W), connectivity (smartphones require integrated cellular modems, while tablets primarily use Wi-Fi), and design philosophy (smartphones are more compact and carrier-dependent, while tablets are PC-like with optional cellular modems).

{"input": "How does the framework capture the reduced-order dynamics?", "predicted": " The results for the phase space can be seen in Figure .\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe framework captures reduced-order dynamics through a combination of an autoencoder and a time-continuous latent space model. The autoencoder compresses high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional latent space, while the latent dynamics are modeled using complex-valued ODEs for each latent variable. These ODEs allow the framework to identify interpretable, time-scale-separated dynamics by solving for parameters \u03bb that govern growth/decay (real parts) and periodic behavior (imaginary parts). This approach unifies dimensionality reduction and dynamic discovery, as shown in the linear ODE example where eigenvalues were accurately recovered. The probabilistic extension further enhances this by quantifying uncertainty, as demonstrated in the KS-equation case where predictive uncertainty bounds increased with time. Key passages include the description of the latent dynamics ODEs [Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation] and the probabilistic extension's application to the KS-equation [Interpretable reduced-order modeling with time-scale separation].\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe framework captures reduced-order dynamics by using an autoencoder to compress high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional latent space and modeling the latent dynamics with complex-valued ODEs.

The introduction further emphasizes the need for efficient methods due to the limitations of traditional approaches like time-domain numerical integration (e.g., Runge-Kutta) and frequency-domain methods, which struggle with irregular excitations and computational efficiency. The proposed method is designed to overcome these limitations by providing an explicit, continuous response function in the time domain, validated through numerical studies comparing it to the Runge-Kutta method.

This is explicitly stated in the abstract and further supported by the results in Fig. 6, which shows that methods accounting for path preference maintain lower entropy in the goal distribution compared to goal-only baselines.

Since without needing to derive and solve the EHEs, as the TNE degree deepens, the complexity of the DBM approach increases much slower than that of KMM method.\nThe core step in DBM modeling is to provide a feasible scheme for detecting, describing, presenting, and analyzing TNE effects and behaviors beyond traditional macroscopic modeling. Based on the non-equilibrium statistical physics, we can use the non-conservative moments of ( f \u2212 f eq ) to describe how and how much the system deviates from the thermodynamic equilibrium state and to check corresponding effects due to deviating from the thermodynamic equilibrium.\nThe non-conservative moments of ( f \u2212 f eq ) open a phase space, and this space and its subspaces provide an intuitive geometric correspondence for describing complex TNE system properties. The development of schemes for checking TNE state, extracting TNE information and describing corresponding TNE effects in DBM are seen in Table .\nActually, this set of TNE describing methods has been applied in many kinds of complex fluid systems such as hydrodynamic instability system , combustion and detonation systems , multiphase flow system , plasma system , etc. Besides the scheme for detecting, describing, presenting, and analyzing TNE effects and behaviors, the DBM incorporates other methods for analyzing the complex physical field.\nOne of them is the tracer particle method.

The provided passages explicitly address this distinction. \n\n1. **Unstandardised CPUE (CPUE per set)**: The text states that unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) showed positive relationships with fishing effort variables like number of hooks, engine power, and number of sets. For example, \"Unstandardised CPUE (individuals per set) was significantly lower in January... Engine power had a significant positive influence on unstandardised CPUE\" [Title].\n\n2. **Standardised CPUE (CPUE per 100 hooks per set)**: When standardised by hook number, the relationships reversed. The passage notes, \"When controlling for hook number using standardised CPUE... the relationships were reversed, with standardised CPUE of bottom longlines significantly higher than that of surface longlines\" [Title]. It further explains that standardised CPUE showed negative relationships with hook number and frequency of sets, indicating diminishing returns at higher effort levels [Title].\n\nThese differences highlight that standardisation for hook number alters the interpretation of CPUE in relation to fishing effort, with unstandardised CPUE reflecting total catch per set and standardised CPUE accounting for gear-specific effort (hooks).
