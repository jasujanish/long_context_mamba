A. Al-Mashaqbeh, M. A. Al-Mashaqbeh, M. A. Al-Mashaqbeh\n]\nIntroduction\nThe proliferation of social media platforms has led to an exponential increase in the amount of information shared online. While this has democratized the flow of information, it has also facilitated the spread of fake news. Fake news, defined as false or misleading information presented as news, has become a significant concern due to its potential to influence public opinion, disrupt democratic processes, and cause social unrest. The challenge of detecting fake news in social media is complex due to the dynamic and often deceptive nature of such content.\nThis survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current approaches and challenges in fake news detection within social media. We will explore various methodologies, including machine learning, natural language processing, and network analysis, and discuss the limitations and future directions of these approaches.\nMethodology\nThe survey is structured into several sections. First, we will define fake news and its implications in the context of social media. Next, we will review the existing literature on fake news detection, categorizing the approaches into content-based, metadata-based, and hybrid methods. We will then discuss the challenges faced in detecting fake news, such as the rapid evolution of fake news tactics, the diversity of languages and platforms, and the need for real-time detection. Finally, we will conclude with a discussion of future research directions and potential solutions.\nContent-Based Approaches\nContent-based approaches focus on analyzing the textual content of the news articles or social media posts. These methods typically involve natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify linguistic features that are indicative of fake news. Common techniques include sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic modeling. For instance, the presence of certain keywords or unusual sentence structures can be red flags for fake news. However, these methods can be limited by the sophistication of the fake news content, which may mimic legitimate news in terms of language and structure.\nMetadata-Based Approaches\nMetadata-based approaches leverage the metadata associated with social media posts, such as the time of posting, the number of shares, the number of followers of the account, and the geographical location of the user. These features can provide valuable insights into the authenticity of the content. For example, a sudden surge in shares or a high number", "actual": ["Ground truth is not established in the paper"]}

The provided passages detail several methods, including Word2Vec (CBOW/skip-gram), GloVe, and others that handle polysemy but fail to capture entailment. The proposed GM_KL model uses a KL divergence-based energy function with Gaussian mixtures to address both polysemy and entailment. Key differences include: 1) GM_KL explicitly models multi-sense distributions via Gaussian mixtures, while others like w2g (single Gaussian) or w2gm (mixture with expected likelihood kernel) do not. 2) GM_KL approximates KL divergence between Gaussian mixtures to handle intractability, whereas methods like w2g or w2gm use simpler metrics (e.g., cosine similarity). 3) GM_KL captures entailment through asymmetric KL divergence, which is not addressed by symmetric metrics in other approaches. Experimental results show GM_KL outperforms others on word similarity and entailment datasets, confirming its superiority in handling polysemy and entailment.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe proposed GM_KL approach differs from other WSD methods by using a KL divergence-based energy function with Gaussian mixtures to capture both polysemy and entailment. Unlike models like w2g (single Gaussian) or w2gm (mixture with expected likelihood kernel), GM_KL approximates KL divergence between Gaussian mixtures to handle intractability and asymmetry in entailment.

{"input": "How does their model improve interpretability compared to softmax transformers?", "predicted": " \n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks how the model improves interpretability compared to softmax transformers. The key difference lies in the use of \u03b1-entmax instead of softmax. Softmax assigns non-zero weights to all context words, making it harder to interpret which words are truly relevant. In contrast, \u03b1-entmax (with \u03b1 > 1) allows for sparse attention weights, meaning some words can have exactly zero attention. This sparsity makes it easier to identify which words or tokens a specific attention head is focusing on, thereby enhancing interpretability. The adaptive nature of \u03b1-entmax further improves this by allowing each head to learn its optimal sparsity level, leading to more specialized and confident attention patterns.\n\nThe passage explicitly states that sparse attention (via \u03b1-entmax) \"eases interpretability\" and provides examples of how sparsity helps in identifying head specializations (e.g., positional heads, BPE-merging heads, interrogation heads). This is directly contrasted with softmax, which lacks such sparsity. The adaptive \u03b1 values also enable heads to vary in sparsity, further aiding in distinguishing their roles.\n\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe model improves interpretability by using \u03b1-entmax instead of softmax, which allows for sparse attention weights. This sparsity enables attention heads to assign exactly zero weights to irrelevant words, making it clearer which tokens are relevant. Additionally, the adaptive \u03b1 values let each head learn its optimal sparsity level, leading to more specialized and confident attention patterns. This contrasts with softmax, which assigns non-zero weights to all words, reducing interpretability.

We chose several target domains from educational controversies, such as homeschooling, single-sex education, or mainstreaming. A novel aspect of the corpus is its coverage of different registers of user-generated Web content, such as comments to articles, discussion forum posts, blog posts, as well as professional newswire articles.\nWe conducted two extensive annotation studies.

Using this model, we annotate 340 documents (approx. 90,000 tokens), reaching a substantial inter-annotator agreement. We provide a hand-analysis of all the phenomena typical to argumentation that are prevalent in our data. These findings may also serve as empirical evidence to issues that are on the spot of current argumentation research.\nFrom the computational perspective, we experiment on the annotated data using various machine learning methods in order to extract argument structure from documents.

It introduces the GTD framework (grammaticality, truthfulness, diversity) as a more principled evaluation method. The experiments on ShapeWorldICE datasets show that while BLEU and SPICE may correlate with truthfulness in simple cases, they fail in complex scenarios (e.g., Spatial-MultiShapes) where high BLEU scores do not reflect actual truthfulness. The GTD framework directly evaluates truthfulness by comparing captions to the ground truth world model, not just reference captions.

For example, the text mentions that if a model is given biased prior knowledge (e.g., more features for one class than another), it should still perform well without being misled. The proposed regularization terms (neutral features, maximum entropy, KL divergence) aim to reduce this sensitivity, thereby enhancing robustness. The key passage is: \"we investigate into the problem in the framework of Generalized Expectation Criteria... to reveal the factors of reducing the sensibility of the prior knowledge and therefore to make the model more robust and practical\" [Introduction].\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nRobustness of a model is defined as its ability to reduce sensitivity to biased prior knowledge, ensuring it performs well even when the knowledge is unbalanced or incomplete.

The results show that ALOHA significantly outperforms the baselines (Kvmemnn, Feed Yourself, Poly-encoder, and BERT bi-ranker) in retrieving the correct language style of specific characters. For instance, ALOHA achieves higher Hits@1/20 scores and lower Mean Rank values compared to the baselines, indicating better accuracy in selecting the ground truth response. Additionally, the human evaluation results show that ALOHA's performance is relatively close to human judgments, further validating its effectiveness. The improvement is attributed to ALOHA's use of Human Level Attributes (HLAs) to guide the language style recovery, which the baselines lack. This integration of HLAs allows ALOHA to align responses with specific character traits, a capability absent in the baselines. The consistent performance across diverse characters and contexts also underscores ALOHA's robustness.

{"input": "Why masking words in the decoder is helpful?", "predicted": " We also plan to use larger pre-trained language models, such as BERT-LARGE, to improve the performance of our model.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks why masking words in the decoder is helpful. The provided passages explain that the model uses a two-stage decoding process. In the second stage, each word of the generated summary draft is masked, and the refine decoder predicts the refined word one-by-one using BERT's contextualized representations. This process is designed to address the issue of incomplete context in the left-context-only decoder by leveraging BERT's ability to model both directions of context during pre-training. Masking words allows the refine decoder to condition on the complete context (both preceding and following words) of each masked word, which improves the quality of generated sequences by reducing repetition and incoherence. This is explicitly stated in the passage: \"the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes\" and \"this process works as follows: first the draft decoder writes a summary draft based on a document, and then the refine decoder edits the draft.\"\n\nThe key passage supporting this is:  \n\"To further improve the naturalness of the generated sequence, we cooperate reinforcement objective with the refine decoder.\"  \nand  \n\"The refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes.\"\n\nThus, masking words enables the refine decoder to utilize BERT's full contextual understanding, leading to more natural and coherent summaries.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nMasking words in the decoder is helpful because it allows the refine decoder to condition on both directions of context (preceding and following words) for each masked word, leveraging BERT's pre-trained contextualized representations. This addresses the limitation of left-context-only decoders, which lack complete context, by providing a more complete input sequence during refinement. This process improves the naturalness and coherence of the generated summaries, as stated in the passage: \"the refine decoding process provides a more complete input sequence which is consistent with their pre-training processes\" [Text Summarization].\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["ecause this process is similar to the cloze task in BERT's pre-train process, therefore by using the ability of the contextual language model the decoder can generate more fluent and natural sequences."]}

It states that the proposed system generates cloze-style questions from an unlabeled corpus and uses them for pre-training. The methodology section details how cloze questions are constructed by matching introduction sentences with passages, forming question-answer pairs. The results show significant improvements in low-resource settings, confirming the feasibility of this approach. The analysis also highlights that questions with lexical overlap between the question and answer benefit most, aligning with the cloze construction process. Thus, the conversion is not only possible but effective as demonstrated by the experiments.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nYes, it is possible to convert cloze-style questions to a naturally-looking questions. The passage describes a system that generates cloze-style questions from an unlabeled corpus by matching introduction sentences with passages, forming question-answer pairs. This process leverages document structure (e.g., introductions summarizing main content) to create questions that are lexically similar to the context. The results show significant improvements in low-resource settings, validating the effectiveness of this approach. The analysis further confirms that questions with lexical overlap between the question and answer benefit most, which aligns with the cloze construction method.

{"input": "What NLP tasks do they consider?", "predicted": " For example, in sentiment classification, we may know that the positive class is more frequent than the negative class.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe passage discusses three regularization terms used to address bias in prior knowledge for NLP tasks. The first is the neutral features regularization term, which uses common words as neutral features to prevent bias toward classes with more labeled features [Introduction]. The second is the maximum entropy regularization term, which constrains the predicted class distribution to be uniform, useful when no class distribution knowledge is available [Method]. The third is the KL divergence regularization term, which compares the predicted class distribution to a reference distribution, allowing for more accurate control of class imbalance [Method]. These terms are introduced to make models more robust to biased prior knowledge.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nThe three NLP tasks considered in the paper are: (1) using neutral features to prevent bias by assuming uniform distribution over classes [Introduction], (2) applying maximum entropy regularization to enforce uniform class distribution when no prior knowledge is available [Method], and (3) employing KL divergence between predicted and reference class distributions to handle imbalanced data with known or estimated class distributions [Method].\n</answer>\n", "actual": ["text classification for themes including sentiment, web-page, science, medical and healthcare"]}
{"input": "What previous methods is their model compared to?", "predicted": " We also use Fisher's method to combine p-values from 10 runs of each model to determine significance.\nResults: The results of the question classification experiments are shown in Table TABREF7 . The baseline model (Li and Roth BIBREF6 ) achieves 0.516 MAP on the ARC dataset. The CNN model achieves 0.552 MAP, a gain of +0.036. The BERT-QC model achieves 0.654 MAP, a gain of +0.138 over the baseline. The BERT-QC model also achieves 0.654 MAP on the TREC-50 dataset, and 0.654 MAP on the GARD dataset. These results show that BERT-QC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple question classification datasets.\nError Analysis: We performed an error analysis on 50 ARC questions where the BERT-QC system did not predict the correct label, with a summary of major error categories listed in Table TABREF20 .\nAssociative Errors: In 35% of cases, predicted labels were nearly correct, differing from the correct label only by the finest-grained (leaf) element of the hierarchical label (for example, predicting Matter INLINEFORM0 Changes of State INLINEFORM1 Boiling instead of Matter INLINEFORM2 Changes of State INLINEFORM3 Freezing). The bulk of the remaining errors were due to questions containing highly correlated words with a different class, or classes themselves being highly correlated. For example, a specific question about Weather Models discusses \u201cenvironments\u201d changing over \u201cmillions of years\u201d, where discussions of environments and long time periods tend to be associated with questions about Locations of Fossils. Similarly, a question containing the word \u201cevaporation\u201d could be primarily focused on either Changes of State or the Water Cycle (cloud generation), and must rely on knowledge from the entire question text to determine the correct problem domain. We believe these associative errors are addressable technical challenges that could ultimately lead to increased performance in subsequent models.\nErrors specific to the multiple-choice domain: We observed that using both question and all multiple choice answer text produced large gains in question classification performance \u2013 for example, BERT-QC performance increases from 0.516 (question only) to 0.654 (question and all four answer candidates), an increase of 0.138 MAP.

{"input": "Does their NER model learn NER from both text and images?", "predicted": " This result is significant because it shows that the modality attention module can be used to improve the performance of text-only NER models, without the need for additional visual contexts. This is particularly useful for social media posts where images are not always available or are not provided by the user.\n</think>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe question asks whether the NER model learns from both text and images. The passage explicitly states that the proposed model incorporates visual contexts for NER tasks, which is a novel contribution. For example, it mentions leveraging \"auxiliary modalities\" like images to resolve ambiguities in text (e.g., disambiguating \"monopoly\" with an image of a board game). Additionally, the model uses a \"modality attention module\" to dynamically select between text, character, or visual features at each decoding step. The SnapCaptions dataset, which pairs text captions with images, is used to train and evaluate the model, further confirming the integration of both modalities. The results also show improved performance when visual contexts are included, validating the use of images in the NER process.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\nYes, the NER model learns from both text and images. The passage describes a multimodal NER system that integrates visual contexts (images) with textual information to improve entity recognition, especially in noisy social media posts. This is achieved through a modality attention module that adaptively selects the most informative modality (text, characters, or images) at each decoding step.
